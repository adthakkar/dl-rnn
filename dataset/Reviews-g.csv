561589,B000MXTJ4S,A391VB8TEGVB5C,Pamela,0,0,5,1300147200,Amazing Multi Purpose Spice Blend!!!,"This is a fantastic all purpose spice blend. Each box comes with a 3.5 ouch pouch of the Tandoori spice mixture which goes a very long way. I did try to make it per the instructions for making the Chicken Masala but found it a bit too much spice all over the meat. However, I have discovered a perfect use for it. We toss it into vegetables that we roast in the oven. I've used it to coat and toast assorted nuts for snacks. It's rich, smokey and wonderfully flavorful. You can make it as heavy or light as you wish. Basic recipe..veggies scrubbed and chopped in 1 inch chunks: 3 large regular potatoes,3 large sweet potatoes, 2 onions, 1# bag baby carrots, 1 large bunch fresh broccoli in pieces. This is my favorite mixture. I then toss all the veggies in a huge bowl with some sea salt, olive oil and about 2-4 Tablespoons of the spice mixture depending on the heat you want. It's not very spicy but a little does go a long way. Once all tossed and coated, on a large oiled baking sheet, I bake at 425 degrees for about 25 minutes, stir with a spatula and continue roasting until done...depending on thickness of veggies, it could take another 25 or more. This is FANTASTIC! You can use these veggies for pita pockets, with tortillas and eggs for breakfast burritos or even alone as a side dish. When our favorite Indian grocery store closed, I panicked and found this online so I could have a backstock. The best thing about getting a case of 12 is that there is enough to share and plenty for backstock. After roasting assorted nuts and seeds for salads, I shared them with a coworker who is also now hooked. For an interesting all purpose seasoning, this is top notch. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MXTJ4S"">Badshah Masala, Tandoori Chicken, 3.5-Ounce Box (Pack of 12)</a>"

They aren't going to be able to handle the large. They need to be able to gnaw at it, which they won't be able to do on the larger balls.<br /><br />Third: The liver discs SMELL.

I've got a Chicken and a Liver treat in the ball now and she enjoys them both. It takes effort now to enjoy it, and she works on it for over a week until there's nothing left but a treat disc left in the ball.

Between the two, I have a funky sleep schedule and sometimes go through periods of extreme insomnia.<br /><br />Then, at the airport in Long Beach, CA I found Dream Water. I was a little shocked at the price but decided to try it anyway. Because it was expensive, I tried half a shot and it worked, well, like a dream. A whole shot makes me do weird things in my sleep, but a half shot makes me fall asleep and get a good 6-8 hours with no hangover effect - even during my severe episodes of insomnia.<br /><br />As a nurse, I would like to recommend that you be careful taking it every day. One of the ingredients (5-HTP) can cause serotonin syndrome in certain doses. Since we don't know the exact dose they use, I would look up serotonin syndrome and be on the look out for side effects if you take it regularly. Just in case. I haven't had any side effects, but better safe than sorry.<br /><br />Also, be careful mixing it with certain other meds used to adjust mood (anxiety/depression meds) or other sleep aids - even natural ones. Just a heads up."

Well in short, I am writing this review because after a week, it has worked for me.  Though I do not feel particularly tired by midnight, I am able to fall asleep and stay asleep with this product.<br /><br />The ingredients listed (Melatonin etc.) are nothing new to me, so I am unsure why it is effective or the mixture of their ""Proprietary Sleep & Relaxation Blend 150mg) but I cannot complain.

Not good. As well as screwing up your work day, being tired can lead to getting fat! Sleep deprivation can have neuro-hormonal effects. Studies show it leads to elevated levels of serum ghrelin, which is our appetite-stimulating hormone, and lower levels of leptin, a hormone that tells our brains when we're full. As a result, we take in more calories and thus gain weight. Not to mention, fatigue can also make us sedentary.<br /><br />Follow me on Twitter and on Facebook and on Google+<br /><br />there is a relationship between sleep and health, including weight. So as hard as it is to get seven to nine hours a night, your health depends on it.

When they brought him back they brought along a gallon of whole milk and a container of Nestle Nesquick Strawberry Powder Drink Mix. They said he liked the drink mix. Well, I don't doubt that. The kid just loves milk of any kind. I've never found a taste enhancer to be necessary.<br /><br />I'm probably not going to be using the strawberry drink mix. Right on the front of the container it states that it is 25% less sugar. Hmmmm. Less than what? Out of curiosity, I turned the packet around and found out that sugar was the only food ingredient, if you count sugar as a food. All other ingredients are additives. Well, why should I be giving my kid heaps of additives including sugar with his food when he already loves the pure milk? Our doctor told us to cut down on the boy's sugar intake. All this does is add to it. Oh sure, it might supply a few extra vitamins and minerals but, let's face it, the only food ingredient in this product is sugar. Look over the nutrients yourself, if you like. On the back of the package, it even states that when mixed with low-fat milk, the resulting mix is filled with protein, carbohydrates and happiness. Well, I don't know about the happiness, but all the protein and carbohydrates are coming from the milk, not the sugar-based mixing powder.

They were delicious & I vowed to purchase a waffle iron of my own just so I could whip these up at home! We got a waffle iron before I ordered this mix though & bought Krusteaz waffle mix from our local Wal-mart in the mean time to test out the waffle maker. Krusteaz mix is easy (need eggs & oil) & doesnt require melted butter like Carbons Golden Malted & tastes awesome, much like what we had at the Inn in Branson!

Now I know how good it was which is why I am shocked to be writing this review... We made our 1st batch of waffles using this mix & was sort of put off that we had to add melted butter unlike the Krusteaz store bought which uses oil instead! Aside from that the waffles didnt come out full like all the others we had using the other mix & tasted VERY BLAND wasnt even a little bit malted flavored like we remembered. Had a almost bitter bland flavor, we thought maybe we did something wrong & made a whole new batch & yet again tasted awful! We did use water & not milk however thats what we used with the Krusteaz brand too & it was very good! I cant imagine milk making it have a better or sweeter flavor & am sure that the Inn where we stayed used water rather than go through the expense of using that much milk for a free breakfast for their guests!!! My husband even said next time we should try milk & add some vanilla extract to the mix, which perhaps will make it taste better however that is just to mask the awful bland flavor it has! I considered giving the rest of my tins to people for Christmas however wouldnt want to embarrass myself now knowing how bad it tastes! =( I hate that Im giving the mix a bad review because like I said it was wonderful when we 1st tried it in Branson, maybe some how we received a BAD batch or something either way we are sitting on 5 1/2 tins of UNWANTED mix!!!

Brooks,29,29,5,1219795200,Tastes great and great for you!,"First off let me say that I have been eating vegetarian and soy made meals, burgers, and other concoctions for nearly half my life, from the really great tasting to the not so great tasting. So when I stumbled on this burger mix in my local bulk foods section I jumped on the chance to taste this stuff and am VERY happy I did.<br /><br />Making the burgers is very easy, just add the same amount of warm/hot water to burger mix, stir well, let sit for a while, then form into a patty and cook. Very simple and easy to make. What I like to do is make a bunch of the mix ahead and stick it in the fridge so you can enjoy one almost anytime you want.<br /><br />Now these burgers aren't meant to taste like a beef burger, I would say they are an alternative to the ""real thing"". They are well seasoned and have a great hearty texture to them. Throw them on a bun with some fixings and you have yourself a very health lunch, snack, or dinner.<br /><br />So in addition to my regular veggie burgers that I buy, this mix has become a staple in my health lifestyle and would recommend this to anyone looking for an alternative to meat or even some of those really untasty soy burgers that are out there (there are a few, I know because I ate them for years).<br /><br />PROS:<br />Easy to make.<br />Doesn't taste like beef or any of the frozen soy burgers out there, so if you don't like beef or any of those soy burgers give this stuff a try!<br />Can be made ahead of time and stuck in the fridge.<br />Very healthy, low sodium, yet tastes very well seasoned.<br />Other things can be added to the mix.<br />The mix can be added to regular hamburger to create really tasty meatloaf.<br /><br />CONS:<br />If not mixed with the correct amount of water patties tend to become extremely crumbly and fall apart."

Musicant ""Muse""",8,9,5,1241654400,Nature's Burger - I love it,"One day over 20 years ago I detected a wonderful smell in my kitchen and it turned out to be some Nature's Burger mix + water being prepared by one of my house mates. He was letting it soak in preparation for frying. Eventually I bought some in bulk at the local market and I've kept some on-hand ever since. Occasionally I make a Nature's Burger instead of a hamburger when I have the impulse. Since I only make this occasionally, I keep the mix in a bottle in the refrigerator to ensure freshness. It seems to stay fresh for years if kept this way. Today I glanced at the list of ingredients posted where I buy it in bulk for $2.99/lb:<br /><br />1/4 cup (47 g) Nature's Burger:<br /><br />170 calories<br />25 calories from fat<br />8 grams protein<br /><br />I figure that these burgers cost less than 1/3 of meat burgers, are very tasty and nutritious. What's not to like?<br />- - - -<br />Feb. 24, 2011 edit:<br /><br />Today I went to replenish my supply at the Berkeley Bowl and see that the price/pound has been jacked up to 4.29. Argh! So, I inquire if they have the boxes (I remembered that buying it at Amazon was barely more than the bulk at the Berkeley Bowl), and was directed to where it would likely be if they had it and sure enough they had a selection of various Fantastic Foods products in 10 oz boxes. The price/pound was about the same as bulk, so I got a box. Currently, Amazon's price (comes to 3.33/pound) is easily the best I can get so I'm buying 12 boxes here.<br /><br />This is cheaper than ground beef, and I figure better for you in a lot of ways, though it's probably a bit lower in protein content. Anyway, it's quite delicious and easy to prepare. Lately I soak 2 oz in 3 oz water for a few minutes. I don't bother to use my hands to form patties, I just scoop it out of a rounded bowl using a rubber spatula and press down with utensils to form the patty right on an olive oiled cast iron skillet. Fry on one side and press lightly with a spatula to flatten somewhat after turning, then fry the 2nd side. I like them between toasted whole wheat bread slices with a little mayo and some lettuce and perhaps a slice of red onion.<br /><br />Edit 3.11.12: Lately I think these are definitely on the salty side, but I'm still eating them very regularly. I get a box of 10 boxes sent to me every 3 months, it's 15% off that way, with free shipping. I'm now adding 10% by weight of egg whites powder and storing in a bottle, once I open a package. This adds some protein, and the fried patties come out nicely. My formula to form a patty is to boil 2.6 oz water and pour over 1.55 oz of this mix, stir, and after sitting about 30 seconds, pour onto a hot skillet, flatten a bit, fry both sides over low-medium heat."

Sometimes I've kept on hand some NB muffins as grab-n-go snacks or as quick entrees-for-one, since my family won't even try it. (all the more for me!)  Last week I made and savored a Nature's Burger Patty Melt, toasted crispy whole grains bread, toasty/caramelized onion, crispy NB patty, a smattering of mustard to bring out the zing of the (imitation) cheddar cheese. Serve with kosher pickle and baked chips, so good and satisfying. Another way I like NB, I have some super zesty relish and NB takes the inedible heat off the relish so I can enjoy the pepper flavor.

The meat is obviously not pure meat, and considering the needs for price, microwavable, and preservation, I understand, and accept it.<br /><br />One of these meals satisfies my hunger for awhile, maybe an hour or two, it depends. I have paid in the range of $3.80 for these in truck stops and mini-marts as they are otherwise hard for me to find, being on the road.

I care about the foods that they eat, so I make a concerted effort to make sure that I am feeding them the best foods that I can provide. While I believe the best foods, nutritionally, are whole foods, eating human foods frequently has not been good for my doggies teeth. It makes their breath smell worse and increases the plaque on their teeth.<br /><br />The next best option is frozen dog food or raw bones, but neither of those options are suitable to our lifestyle. So I look for dry dog kibble made with a solid ingredient profile.<br /><br />With the melamine, pet-food scare that was in the news a while back, I was/am more comfortable with food that is made in North America. FirstMate owns and operates their facilities in British Columbia, Canada. They were the first company to produce grain-free food in 1995. 73% of the protein is from wild herring (local from BC!) & Chicken. The remaining 27% of protein is from the barley, rice, oatmeal and potato.<br /><br />My dogs are happy on this food.

They wanted to know what they could do to satisfy me as a customer? I'd mentioned how the price was much cheaper at my store & if they could lower their price here so I may purchase it again in the future.  The seller was quick to respond with an offer for a nice refund in an attempt to match my local price.  It still cost me more through Amazon but, I paid for the convenience of home delivery. Therefore, I gladly accepted the offer. It was also mentioned that my request to lowering their price would be brought forward at their next meeting. It appears they have indeed lowered the price from $10.98 to $8.48. If you have Amazon Prime, your shipping & handling is FREE and the total price balances out. I would possibly consider paying that price,  especially if I'd bought other items. However, if you need to include S & H, then the $8.48 price is still much too high.

If you look at the ingredients before you purchase the bottle, you won't purchase the bottle. I had read about Fee Brothers Bitters in an old New York Times article about the rebirth of cocktail culture, and I had very high hopes. Unfortunately, I assumed they were artisanal and naturally flavored, and alcoholic like Peychaud's or Angostura. The ingredients list reads like a pack of Orange Drink: Water, Glycerin, Flavors - Natural and Artificial Extracts and Flavors. Also, no alcohol, which is a no-no, if you're mixing real drinks.<br /><br />These bitters taste bad. They smell like an orange popsicle but have a truly bad and overpowering votive candle scent. If you want orange flavor in your drinks, pick any other orange bitters. This is a sure way to water down your drink, without adding natural flavor. I've used this in a couple of drinks and been duly disappointed in each one. The only tastes it imbues are those of chemicals and sourness. DO NOT USE THESE BITTERS!!!"

So far what I've discovered is Monkey Picked Oolong and Silver Needle White tea are by far my top 2 in taste.  Since I'm drinking tea for health reasons, I don't add milk, cream, honey, or fancy German rock sugar as that would appear to defeat the purpose.  (Yes honey is natural but still freaking sugar.)  Those 2 types of tea seem to be naturally sweet, especially the silver needle white.  I gave some to a friend and he asked how much honey I put in it.  ""NONE, motha%#$@^!  That @$#! is straight white tea, *&^%$!"" :O  Most Black teas, even expensive highly rated ones seem to taste like hot unsweetened Lipton, meh.  Rooibos tastes like it smells: Hay/cattle feed pellets, bleh, very disappointed.  Pu'erh was decent but much like Black. I haven't tried loose leaf green tea yet but will soon.  But Oolong?  Yes please.  I've tried several, including Teavana's Monkey Picked and it is indeed very high quality and perhaps a little more 'vegetal?, with giant expanding leaves but it's roughly twice the price of EnjoyingTea's, which is similar.  And that's a very good thing, slightly vegetal /slightly sweet, and you can 'feel' it adding to your lifespan with every sip.  Ah.  I tried Rishi's silver needle white and it's just plain amazing but pricey.  I just ordered some from EnjoyingTea and am guessing I will soon wind down the testing phase of my tea experience and decide on EnjoyingTea's Monkey Picked Oolong and Silver Needle White (pending taste test) as my 'everydayers' due to a yet unmatched combo of quality and price.  5 stars."

561817,B001I4TC6A,A17HMM1M7T9PJ1,Timothy B. Riley,4,4,4,1306886400,A surprisingly complex taste for an ultra hot sauce,"I enjoy all types of hot sauces but I prefer those with complex flavors, not just heat.  Black Mamba is hot, make no mistake about it, but it also has an almost fruity flavor to it (by the way, Chocolate Habaneros are called that because of their color, not their flavor.)  It does have hot pepper extract in it (capsaicin) which is often added to mediocre sauces just in order to boast the heat, sometimes at the expense of the overall taste of the finished product.  Black Mamba seems to have limited the amount to just enough to create even more fire than a habanero has own it's own (and Chocolate Habs are one of the hottest) without overdoing it.<br /><br />When I open the lid there is usually a small dab of the sauce on the inside of the cap.  I touch my finger to it and transfer about two drops to my mouth.  The heat is relatively slow, building up over a matter of a dozen or so seconds until my face starts to feel flushed.  After a full minute I feel perspiration on my brow and the pain starts to pleasantly build.  Not so much pain that I feel miserable, just enough to feel that endorphin rush that a good sauce brings with it.  The pain goes away in about 10 minutes but I am still left with some wonderful flavors in my mouth.<br /><br />This is the type of sauce that I add to a large pot of soup or chili, a glaze for meat and to add a punch to a stew or a curry.  One thing to note though; this is a VERY small bottle.  Two ounces is about 60 milliliters (one of those airplane bottles of liquor holds only 50 ml.)  I feel that the price is pretty high for such a small amount of sauce.  Still, it is tasty and I am glad that I bought it."
561818,B001I4TC6A,ART4L9CVJNTD9,jones0308,0,0,4,1312243200,Just wait for it...,I tried this at my brothers rehearsal dinner as a dare that clearly I was not going to turn down.  I put one drop on a tortilla and started chewing.  I thought I was in the clear until about 20 seconds later when my mouth was on fire.  I love hot sauces and regularly use very hot ones and this put them all to shame.  I was chomping down tortillas and it took a good 30 minutes for the burn to stop.  I was very pleased with this sauce but buyer beware--- this is not for those who can't handle heat.
561819,B001I4TC6A,AUAXNVACC3MJL,A. Sarich,0,0,4,1308873600,Heat without compromising flavor,"One of my friends is a chocolatier. He was looking for interesting ingredients to add to his confections, so someone bought him a bottle of Black Mamba. He added 1 drop per 1oz square of ultra rich milk chocolate. After the first bite, I was impressed with the complex taste of the hotsauce, and how nicely it complemented the flavors in the chocolate though I was a little underwhelmed with the heat. Boy way I wrong.<br /><br />Over the next 5 minutes or so, the heat continued to grow. I felt the burn in my mouth, and my nose started to run. After about 10 minutes, I was sweating and my face was about 6 shades of red. At that point, he brought me a glass of milk and bowl of pretzels. Initially, I had pushed them aside, but the heat lingered long enough that the endorphins started to wear off and I ended up giving in to the starchy, creamy relief of milk and pretzels. If I didn't have them, I wouldn't have been miserable, unlike with some other hot sauces, but I definitely wouldn't have been comfortable.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great spicy hot sauce that doesn't compromise on taste. My pet peeve with hot sauces are heat at the expense of taste. This one delivers on both fronts. At $15 per 2oz, it's a bit expensive for daily use, but to spice up special treats, it's a must."

I've read online that the sauce is estimated to be in excess of 2 million SCU's. That's BS. I'd equate the heat to habanero seeds. Incorporating 4-5 drops on a burger or bowl of soup will certainly give your food some kick. I'll concede that the sauce is more about heat than flavor. With that said, the flavor is still pretty damn good. I got my bottle roughly 4 months ago and I've almost finished it. I intend to get another bottle when this one's done.<br /><br />Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention, this sauce makes for a horrible masturbation aid!

Vicks is petroleum (yuck!) based and contains ""fragrance"" and other chemicals.

I love the natural ingredients of the product but there is something that I can't pinpoint in this product that broke my toddler son out in a rash.  I used it on his chest, back, and a small bit under his nose during a common cold episode.  Subsequently, his cheeks became a little irritated. Also, his back and chest broke out in a rash.  Luckily it went away when I discontinued use on him.  I knew that this ointment was the contributing factor because although he has sensitive skin, I have narrowed down what works for him without breaking him out.  I cannot say that it won't work for other toddlers/babies but I can say that proceeding with caution is one's best bet as there may be irritants in this product...so be very careful.  It's a good thing though that by me having two jars, my husband and I can still use the ointment without a problem.

I know it's ""Chicken of the Sea"", but perhaps this stuff is from a different part of the chicken than their regular canned tuna!

Rice vinegar (milder than the regular stuff) or lemon juice round it off. Great in a salad, or add a little mayonnaise for a fantastic sandwich.<br /><br />This is the REAL tuna."

I thought, I loathe tuna in water,(except when it's swimming, I'm all for that) somehow it is not right with my world. So I looked on amazon, and there was the answer to my tuna conundrum. I got it home lightening-quick with amazon prime, and cracked a can open. Eureka! This sheiss is the bomb! I even eat the oil with it, without draining it. I recommend red wine vinegar (the pomegranate flavored one is good) a sprinkling of coarse salt, some freshly-cracked pepper and you have a satisfying lunch. You get 24 cans for $42 if you subscribe, which is a little more costly than when I buy it at the store for $1.44 a can. It's up to you if the extra cost of (approximately) $7.44 is worth it. I usually buy it at the store 2 cans at a time for one reason; tuna contains mercury and if I have a small case of the best tuna I have ever eaten just lying around eye-balling me, I'm gonna gorge myself (eating 1 or 2 cans in a day) and end up with a fist full of yummy-tasting mercury from hell-heaven in my body. Yes?<br />So, my conclusion?<br />If you are a hermit who never leaves the house or someone who lives in bum-fight, Idaho, and all they have is Chicken of the Please Shoot Me Now, then buy it here. If you are a consummate city-dweller with access to 1.5 million brands of tuna, then buy it a few cans at a time and preserve a little lettuce in the process. Either way, you will think it's worth it for such sublime, insurmountably awesome flavor, like an angel just had an orgasm in your mouth."

I've been looking for this tea for quite a while; it's a VERY rare combination in the United States. Tega ships it in packs of 6 with 20 sachets in each pack. The sachets themselves are paired together in the box and must be ripped apart (they are perforated, which is easy). This is common with organic teas because when you're done you can compost the entire thing.<br /><br />The tea is mild and calming; it's definitely not a spicy or awakening tea. The blackcurrant brings a fruity flavor and aroma to the tea, but it isn't overpowering. Every person that I have shared this tea with has fallen in love with the fact that it isn't powerful. Many of them have preferred to drink it without any sweetening agents, others have said that a little honey makes it just perfect.<br /><br />You can steep the tea for as little as 2-3 minutes to get a full, robust flavor--or you can steep the tea for the entire time you drink it; it doesn't become bitter like green teas.<br /><br />Despite the fact that it's caffeine-free and therefore non-addiction inducing, nary a winter day goes by when I'm not compelled to heat up a mug of this tea."

It and Mello Yello were the only sodas I liked as a kid. I've stopped drinking it regularly for health reasons, but anyone who decides to drink the golden elixir doesn't do it because it's healthy. That's a given.<br /><br />Dietary concerns aside, Mountain Dew (and other sodas) have gotten too sweet for me as I age. I finally found the Throwback at a local drug store and decided to do a side by side comparison between the Throwback formula and the current Mtn Dew. Comparing the ingredients, it seems the primary difference is that the Throwback formula replaces the HFCS with real cane sugar. Also, there are fewer calories and sugar carbs in the Throwback version. The big beverage companies claim there is no taste difference between HFCS and sugar. But when I tasted them side-by-side, the Throwback has a mellower, less sickly-sweet aftertaste. To my taste buds, it's just better.<br /><br />I don't indulge in soda often. But when I do, I'd want it to be the Throwback version. Let's hope Pepsi Co keeps it around for a while."

While it has apparently been a regional release, many large retailers (including Target) have carried it on and off since 2009. And from recent accounts, Pepsi is going to leave it on the shelves even longer now (see article in Comments section below.) So check locally first. My Super Target carries exactly this 12-pack for three to four dollars. Compare with the thirty-five bucks (including exorbitant shipping) some Amazon merchants are trying to get!<br /><br />On to the review. I will keep it short, because the important thing is that old fashioned Mountain Dew (labeled ""Throwback"" just like ""Heritage"" for Dr. Pepper) tastes much better with real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup. Less harsh and more enjoyable. If you drank Mountain Dew prior to the sugar switch back in the mid 1980s, you will almost surely prefer this. For younger drinkers only accustomed to fake sugar, who knows? Their taste buds may have been irreparably harmed. LOL<br /><br />It doesn't come in moonshine jugs, but at least you get Willy the Hillbilly on the cans. One recent tweak is that orange juice concentrate is back in the formula. I didn't catch the initial 2009 Throwback release but evidently it was missing the OJ. I would be curious to try this retro brew in glass bottles, but since I don't recall doing so even when I was younger, it's not a dealbreaker like it might have been for Coke (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000GIZRY"">Coca Cola, 11.5 oz.</a>)."

[...]<br /><br />Spotted the new package on the shelves and was not really sure if it was PepsiCo Mountain Dew, so I inspected the box. Delighted to find that this was indeed genuine Dew and even better... ORANGE JUICE is back in the list of ingredients! This is much closer to the Dew of yore.<br /><br />While it is closer to the original, the formula still seems tweaked. The HFCS version has 46g of carbs, the new Throwback still has 44g. IIRC the original either had 42g of carbs or 46g to match the HFCS version. Also, the ""new"" Throwback seems to lack some of the yellow die from the original (I can remember it staining the can - this almost looks clear).

Even better, shade grown coffee helps our migratory birds and also provides richer resources for farmers. How? Shade trees often produces secondary fruit or nut crops as well as firewood from falling branches. The trees provide homes for birds and other wildlife that eat insects allowing for fewer if any pesticide use. (This particular coffee is organic, so that's no pesticides, of course.) Likewise, the leaf litter helps fertilize the coffee plants. The shade also allows the coffee to mature naturally in a slow manner providing for better flavor. It also means you usually need to use less coffee than the regular can coffees bringing the cost closer to what many people are used to paying."

Tetleys divided the bags into various types, two being the Classic Blend (square bags) and British Blend (Round Bags).

Amazon still does sell it as a Prime eligible product but that is also double what it costs locally.<br />Big mistake. The difference between British Blend and Classic Blend is night and day. You see, when I make my tea I brew enough for two cups at a time. So the remainder sits for several hours before I reheat it. While the first cup is tolerable the second one is almost as bad as Lipton's, which I drank for many years.<br />I have managed to make it drinkable by purchasing several boxes of British Blend and I brew my tea with one British Blend bag and one Classic Blend bag. This improves the taste quite a bit. But doesn't help at all for the second cup. By the time I get to the last half of the second cup I end up throwing it away most of the time.<br />The reason I switched from Lipton's is because the first cup of Lipton's was bitter and any reheated tea tasted like the dregs of a coffee pot when the coffee has been warming for 6-8 hours.<br />With British Blend the first cup is the ultimate and the second reheated cup taste better than freshly brewed Lipton's or Tetley Classic Blend.<br />Unfortunately I am stuck with at least 400 more bags of Classic Blend before I can go back to using two British Blend bags for my tea. The only good thing is that Tetley British Blend does go on sale at the supermarket every couple of months but if you don't get there the morning the sale starts, they are sold out because people who like fine tasting tea rush to the store and buy it all up immediately.<br />Perhaps I should start brewing only one cup at a time and use 3 or 4 bags of Classic Blend and then treat myself with British Blend. That would rid me of the Classic Blend without having to dump so much of the Classic Blend.<br />No matter what, I won't be buying any more Classic Blend and will stick with British Blend no matter what the price since it is the best tasting tea around, particularly if you reheat your tea like I do."

This one was great, exactly what I was looking for! I've started with regular Earl Grey, not decaffeinated tea, and only later dared to try decaffeinated version, and to my surprise didn't feel big difference. From now on I only drink this tea. It's very strong, even for big 16 oz. cup, aromatic and flavorful. The price is affordable too, especially when buying 6 packs and overall cheaper than at my local grocery store. Someone mentioned that he is bothered to throw away so many wrappers, but I think that having separate foil packages is a big plus. I used to drink tea that had paper packages, and those didn't stay fresh for a long time. As soon as you open the box and over time they will loose their aroma. With this tea individual foil packages the tea stays fresh almost indefinitely. Don't get over obsessed with the environmental hysteria, think rationally. We have many tree farms that were planted for this purpose, so using individual wrapped tea few times a day won't kill your wild forests. Things are not as bad as the media presents it. There are many ways we can be more careful about our waste and consumption, but this is not one of them."

Olive oil contains healthy fats and antioxidants that can help fight heart disease and cancer.  Mantova Extra Virgin Olive Oil comes in a 3-liter can, and is sold in a two-pack with free SuperSaver Shipping.  Because the oil is sealed in a metal can, it stays fresher longer than olive oil sold in plastic containers.<br /><br />It has a light, fresh taste and a clean aroma that enhances every dish.  We especially like it for dipping - I add salt, oregano, garlic and cracked pepper to a dish of the oil, and we dip Italian bread in it.  It's one of our favorite appetizers.<br /><br />Olive oil is also wonderful for your hair and skin.  It absorbs quickly and isn't sticky.  I also add a tablespoon of olive oil to our cat's and dog's food, to improve digestion and make their coats shiny.  I've gotten to the point that I never buy canola, corn or sunflower oil anymore - olive oil is only a little more expensive and is so much better for us.<br /><br />If you're looking for extra virgin olive oil, Mantova is a great brand.

It's amazing just how bland this coating is.  It also has a disgustifying effect on the chicken.  My daughter rejected it, and rejecting food is something she very rarely does.  Our pet rats did not reject it.<br /><br />This is a product for the crowd who think Hostess products are good.<br /><br />To add insult to injury, I bought two boxes of this destructive product for the price of one.  So now I have that second unused box wasting space in my house.  I was going to leave that box somewhere off-property where it can be found by someone else to use.  But that would be a disservice to the other person.  So in the trash it goes.<br /><br />With even moderately tasty food, when one eats enough of it, one feels fine.  But when one fills up with chicken treated with Shake 'N Bake, one ponders what relief a gastric lavage would bring.  This product is absolute crap."

I just wanted to see people choke, cough, spit and wheeze when they tried this. Quite the opposite happened. These became an IMMEDIATE crowd pleaser. The chip itself is as perfect as a kettle chip can get: crunchy, thick with a robust potato flavor and not greasy. The spices. Dear God the spices. It takes a few seconds, but when the habanero kicks in, yeah, you'll ""feel alive"". The level of heat does not take to your knees. I found myself going for more! Certainly ingesting these does not come without hazards (tear jerking restroom moments), but I guarantee you it is quickly forgotten after that bag stares you in the face when you open the pantry. I'll be ordering more once I'm down to four bags. For the rest of the nation buried under snow, a bag of this will put your body in the Bahamas."

I can barely get down 10 chips before my nose and eyes are watering and my mouth is on fire. I'd compare their taste, texture, and crunchiness to Tim's Cascade Jalapeno (which I love,) but they're probably around 5 times as hot as those chips. Don't get me wrong, these things are pretty tasty, but I'm still working on polishing off my first bag that I received 3 days ago.<br /><br />I'm probably going to keep some for myself to eat, since they don't go bad for a year from now, but the others I'm probably going to use for pranks on my family and friends.

I have several bottles of Blair's hot sauces so I knew that I would definitely not be disappointed with the spice level on these chips.  The first few chips that I put in my mouth, were spicy, but more flavor than I expected.  So I ate a couple more.  Then the heat intensity starts to kick in. Unlike other habanero foods, this one had a bit of a creeper affect rather than hitting you like a freight train from the beginning.  Then my mouth started to burn and the tears started rolling.  God, how I love that feeling.  Sadistic, I know. They really do make you feel alive.  I keep several bags at work so I can have something to get over the afternoon hump around 3 pm.  They do the job well as I get a level of alertness that caffeine just can't deliver.  It also makes me appear like a more sensitive guy since I am crying the whole time.  Eating these chips has also produced a nice side effect for me - I am unbelievably hydrated throughout the day.  My skin has never looked better.  The only warning I would give when eating these chips is that the pepper powder they use is extremely light. So when you pop them in your mouth, you will inevitably get some up your nose via your nasopharynx.  It will make you sniffle like a coke addict from the 80s. A bit annoying but great for clearing up sinuses. Oh yeah, my best advice is that you should really wash your hands thoroughly before using the bathroom - like 2-3 times.  Otherwise a fate that I wouldn't even wish upon my worst enemy will await you. Let's just say I am prone to learning life lessons the hard way. i won't go into details but it involved milk and was something like a scene out of American Pie."

Gone was the perfect amount of flavoring the chipotle chips had.  Instead the chips had so much seasoning it was darn near falling off the chips.  I've had a few brands of habanero before, but this one tasted nothing like any of them.  It has almost a sweet flavor to it.  I personally didn't care for it at all.  On top of it all, the chips aren't even very hot.  I was very disappointed in how hot both chips were considering the brand is called Death Rain.

The taste of the cranberries, oranges, and nuts (especially the walnuts) blended together to give me that awesome, wonderful taste of fruit cake.  (But not so much that someone who doesn't like fruit cake wouldn't like this bar.  If you don't like fruit cake, don't not try this bar just because I mentioned it tasting, to me, like fruit cake.  It is NOT fruit cake - it just reminds me of it.)  It has been a long time since I've had fruit cake.  That's one bad thing about being vegan - you miss a lot of wonderful treats that you used to enjoy.  Oh, there are companies that make vegan ""treats"", but all the ones I've encountered all use soy (and I don't like soy).  I have not yet found a company that makes vegan treats without soy.  Therefore, I either have to make my own or else miss out.  I have not yet made my own vegan fruit cake, but now I don't have to even try.  This Pure Organic Cranberry Orange Bar satisfies my craving for it.<br /><br />I am grateful for this bar (as well as all the varieties).  There will be times when I just want coffee and a pastry (especially when I am reading a cozy mystery), but I might not have any pastries already made (I can't go to the store to buy any, as I do not eat animal products, and they all have milk, eggs, etc.)  I either have to stop reading and make my vegan version (which I've done many times), or else I can just eat a Pure Bar.  No, I can't just go to the store to buy a pastry, but I can go to the store and buy a Pure Bar.<br /><br />I've had other Pure Bars, but this is the first time I've ever had this particular variety.  I am grateful for it; now I can have something that tastes, to me, like fruit cake, and coffee.  (Or tea, whatever mood I'm in).<br /><br />And not only do these bars tastes good, but they are healthy, organic, vegan, soy-free.  I don't know which is the strongest - the heavenly taste or the heavenly healthiness.<br /><br />I am indeed thankful for these bars.  I never have to worry about soy.  They are awesome tasting, and are always there for me when I need them."

This product was just the thing.  True, it's a ""flavoring"" and therefore not 100% real but the description doesn't lie.  This is as close to the real thing as you're going to get.  I used plenty of fresh strawberries (macerated in sugar) and its juices in my recipe but if I didn't add this secret weapon my cupcakes wouldn't have had the great fruity flavor they did.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea.

They are slightly spicy, but they shouldn't be too spicy for anyone's palette. My 6 year old son really enjoys these, too. My suggestion is to open the 1 pound bag and pour a serving or two into separate containers for snacking. If you eat directly from the 1 pound bag, you are likely to eat the entire thing in one sitting because they are so addicting. I've also tried the Jalepeno Smokehouse and the Salt & Vinegar flavors from Blue Diamond. The Jalepeno Smokehouse are actually a little spicier than the Habanero BBQ if you're wondering.

They went great with beer. But the crunchiness of the dried peas got to me and my husband after a while, so we stopped getting them. When I run across Blue Diamond Bold Wasabi & Soy Sauce Almonds, I was ecstatic. Now I could once again enjoy the taste of Wasabi as well as enjoy the health benefits of almonds at the same time.<br /><br />You can tell that these almonds are flavored as they have a powdery coating. I was a little bit worried as I remembered that some of the wasabi peas were very hot. In case you're not familiar with wasabi, it is the green paste that is typically served with sushi and diluted down with soy sauce. It is also known as Japanese horseradish, and is quite hot. Fortunately, Blue Diamond has tempered the wasabi with  the savory taste of  soy sauce and it's not as hot as it is in Japanese snack food. But make no mistake, it still has a nice kick, but it doesn't have a long lasting effect. The initial punch of heat fades out quickly to make way for the salty, slightly smoky flavor of soy sauce, making it a very enjoyable snack.<br /><br />5 star snack!"

562220,B004HOSGWE,AIBRTGBN07D6A,Scott,0,0,4,1224460800,You can definitely taste the salt & vinegar,"Even though I (thought) I hated them for 25 years, I am a recent convert to the great taste and nutritional value of almonds. It is hard to find a quality almond. Some are too hard, some are too ""dry,"" some are too plain. Without a doubt, Blue Diamond produces the best-tasting almonds. I have had many different brands of almonds and if you are eating them out of the bag (IE, not cooking with them or mixing them with something), quality can go a long way. Blue Diamond almonds are very flavorful on their own. I typically do not like a completely plain almond, so decided to try their Bold series.<br /><br />The Bold Series has several different flavors. Some of these are hit and miss with me. Some of the flavors are ""too"" bold, and some taste great the first few almonds, but quickly overwhelm you. Since my favorite Blue Diamond product is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSX4D2"">Blue Diamond Almonds Roasted Salted, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a>, I thought I would give these a try.  I have been disappointed with other products within their Bold line, but these aren't too bad.<br /><br />You can definitely taste the salt and vinegar, and it's pretty much the same amount of flavor you would find with Salt and Vinegar potato chips.  Normally, I can eat half a can of Blue Diamond almonds in one sitting, however the strong flavor of the vinegar overwhelms me a bit and I can usually only eat half a serving of these at once.  If you're a big Salt and Vinegar fan however, these shouldn't be a problem.  While the Salt and Vinegar Almonds aren't my favorite in the Bold line, I do like them much better than the other varieties, and will probably get them again.  If you've never tried them before, you may want to start with purchasing just one can rather than 12."

The most important qualities of almonds, for me, are freshness, quality, and careful roasting. Blue Diamond almonds get 5 stars on all those parameters.<br /><br />And I've tried all their flavors, especially their ""BOLD"" line. Alas, their definition of ""BOLD"" is apparently ""a little too spicy for kids."" This flavor is okay, as a change of pace, but doesn't exactly set my taste buds a-""blazin'."" It doesn't taste like Buffalo wings -- it's too sweet and not vinegary enough. And it's definitely not spicy enough. I realize that real Buffalo wing spice can be brutal, and might not suit a mass-market snacking product. But really, they haven't even tried here. There's not even a hint of Tabasco, for example.<br /><br />As I said, this is a pleasant enough flavor, especially if you need a little change from, say, my favorite, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4QJK"">Jalapeno Smokehouse</a>.

The flavor is definitely bold.  It reminds me of the horseradish flavor that is common in many deli mustards.  It has grown on me over time, but I would like to see a little more balance with the ""soy"" flavor.  This is where I like the other flavors that I mentioned better as I think these are bold but better balanced.  If you love wasabi or horseradish, this will probably be right up your alley.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about ""bowel tolerance"" or ""happy bowels"" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

This one while good was not great for me.  When I hear the word ""Bold"" I expect something over the top and this one was just sort of medium.  It seems that they aimed for the middle of the road when it comes to being a spicy flavor!  We have Buffalo Wing restaurants here that offer about 6 grades of spiciness from hot to death and this wasn't even close.<br /><br />If I compare this to the Blue Diamond Wasabi & Soy spiciness it is not even in the same galaxy.  This is still a good flavor but not what I was expecting.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor does have 9% of your daily intake of sodium which is almost twice the amount in many of the other Blue Diamond flavors. It has even 50% more salt than the Bold Salt `n Vinegar flavor? For that reason I will eat this flavor more sparingly.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you, just watch the salt.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them. Since they have a more moderate flavor than what I was expecting for a ""Bold"" product and contain so much salt I gave it 4 stars.  I eat these almonds because they taste good and are healthier for you but the extra salt in this one negates some of the health benefits in my opinion. This is still a good flavor and I like them but not love them!"

But it is not a NO sweetener like the label claims, it is a LOW calorie sweetener when you do the math.<br /><br />The company says on their website that are 202 calories and 53 grams of carbs for a cup of Ideal. So it is 12.5 cals/3.3 carbs a tablespoon, and 4 cals/1.1 carbs a teaspoon. So not an actual NO calorie sweetener like the bag says. They list 0 calories because they can since it is under 5 calories for the serving size they have listed, but on a large pouch meant for baking you would use way more than a teaspoon -- especially if you wanted to make any of the sweet items they have pictured on the front of the bag! The label should be changed to reflect its intended purpose. It's like saying a can of regular soda is calorie free if you list it as being 42 servings.<br /><br />That said, I will still be using it since it has less than a third of the calories of sugar, about a quarter of the carbs and tastes very good.

Over the years we have tried them all and found each product wanting - until we found Ideal.<br /><br />This sweetener has the taste and texture of sugar without any of the issues surrounding other sugar substitutes. It avoids the question of health risks attributed to aspartame. It does not have the 'grassy' taste of Stevia; the 'cold' sensation of erythritol; or, what we find to be, the after-taste of Splenda.<br /><br />For baking, it is unparalleled. Even our friends who eat sugar cannot tell that we use Ideal. We bake custards and crustless cheesecakes with Ideal and no one knows that they are sugar free. We use it in confections such as fudge and chocolate truffles with exceptional results.<br /><br />Like many other sugar alternatives, Ideal will not caramelize. This is not a fault of the product but rather a chemical dynamic of sugar alcohol based sweeteners. However, this seems is a small price to pay for a sweetener that is otherwise indistinguishable from sugar.<br /><br />Whether you choose to use the brown sugar substitute (which does not have the actual sugar found in Splenda's brown sugar blend) or the white sweetener, we are sure that you will find Ideal a wonderful alternative to sugar. We recommend it to our friends who are diabetic or who are looking to cut out sugar for other reasons. They all agree that it is the best tasting alternative to sugar on the market today."

One of the ingredients (5-HTP) can cause serotonin syndrome in certain doses. Since we don't know the exact dose they use, I would look up serotonin syndrome and be on the look out for side effects if you take it regularly. Just in case.

I've tried every over-the-counter sleep aid there is, and some help, some don't -- this stuff really works.  It makes me very drowsy, and far as I can tell, there are no adverse side effects.  Both flavors are subtle and pleasant, and contain no calories.  The active ingredient is sodium 80 mg, which might be of concern to those on a low-sodium diet, although 80 mg only represents 3% of the average adult's recommended intake.  The rest is their ""secret blend"" of what I presume is the usual herbals that are reputed to relax you.

Even if you buy it by the 12-pk, it's about $2 a pop! I guess it deepends, then, on how bad you want to sleep.

When it came I had my family do a blind taste test for me. It actually tastes pretty similar to the Collins, both are sweet and taste like almonds. But the Teisseire has an additional nutty or earthy flavor that the Collins does not. It's made from almond extract, not just flavoring, and sugar, not corn syrup, and nothing with a scary chemical name.<br /><br />It does cost almost twice as much, plus shipping, but it takes me months to go through a bottle so it's worth it for me. It has a very nice pour spout that eliminates the crusty buildup you get on a screw-top bottle like Collins. My only complaint is the metal container. You can't see how much is left, and I think glass would be less likely to impart a taste. Right now there is no metallic taste at all, but in six months who knows?<br /><br />Note that the Amazon listing is wrong in a couple ways. The bottle is metal, not plastic, and the name is spelled ""Teisseire."" Yes, I know it looks plastic in the photo, but it really is metal shaped like that."

Here are the ingredients: sugar, water, fructose, almond extract.  Great but how does it compare to the other orgeats?  The only other one I have on hand at the moment is from Fee Brothers.  The Fee Bro. while being pretty good does come across as more ""almond-like"" than just tasting like actual almonds.  It's almost too sharp.  The Fee Bro. orgeat does contain some orange flavor (again ""orange-like"" not actual orange).  Teisseire's orgeat  tastes like almonds and it comes through nicely in the cocktails I tried it with (Mai Tai and Japanese).  It doesn't have the orange or rose water that orgeats traditionally have but even without that it tastes better than Fee Brothers'.  The lack of orange water makes it 4 stars instead of 5."

I tried them in various cocktails and Teisseire came in last--a distant last--in every test. Compared with the other two it is thin and its flavor is too weak to stand up to other ingredients in a drink. I do give it bonus points for the nice bottle and pour spout, but it's certainly not worth its price and I do not recommend it for cocktail enthusiasts."

Some genius decided it would be a good idea to replace the artificial colors and flavors generations of Necco lovers have come to adore with things like beet juice, cabbage, and turmeric.  The result of the switch to ""natural"" flavorings and colors is, at best, disappointing, at worst, an unmitigated confectionery disaster.<br /><br />The black Necco, with its sweet quasi-licorice flavoring, was always my favorite.  Now, it's hard to tell it apart from the other Neccos.  There are only mild differences between the flavors of these false Neccos, these fraudulent wafers.  And all the flavors are forgettably bland.<br /><br />The New England Confectionery Company has ditched the old packaging, too.  In a way, the change is a blessing.  The new wrapper lets the Necco lover know not to waste money on the worst product formula change ever.  Forget New Coke/Old Coke; the Necco debacle is unequaled in world history. It makes the Portland Trailblazer's decision to draft Sam Bowie instead of Michael Jordan seem enlightened.<br /><br />What makes the whole sordid affair even harder to accept is company's failure to note the ruination of Necco anywhere on the package.  I bought a sack of the small size rolls and thought I must have purchased an old, stale lot of Necco rejects.  It was only after I tried Neccos from the regular sized roll that I realized something was horribly wrong.<br /><br />Goodbye old friend.  If I had known the fate your maker had in store for you I would have bought a truck load of you and would, perhaps, be savoring one of your delectable pleasure discs right now."

The people at Bear Naked have a philosophy that I love, and which is on the back of every bag: ""we believe food should be hand-made from wholesome and natural ingredients you can actually pronounce."" Although I do eat processed food, I appreciate the appeal of the more traditionally prepared foods, and this granola tops the list for nutrition and taste.<br /><br />Like most granola, it is high in calories and fat, but take note that the fat comes largely from the nuts contained (it also contains expeller pressed canola oil), and it has no trans fat, and only 1.5g of saturated fat per serving. This cereal is softer than most granola, though not soft enough for me to consider it chewy. It does have large chunks of nuts and also contains cranberries and flax seed, for optimal nutritional and digestive health.<br /><br />The six-pack sold on Amazon makes the price per package reasonable (the ingredients are quite expensive), so as a value proposition, I think this is not only a great product, but a great buy.<br /><br />Delicious and nutritious: a great combination that I recommend highly."

What I like the most is that every mouthful is a little different, depending on the mix of banana, granola, and nuts you happen to get. Great with milk or as a snack. Even though the bag looks small in comparison with the boxes of cereal on the grocer's shelf, you get nearly the same amount of stuff, and the quality is 1000% better than any other granola on the market (just compare the list of ingredients and you'll see what I'm talking about.)

The Peanut<br />Butter recall came out. I asked the Bear Naked company if this cereal was involved in the recall. They said no<br />it was not. I still did not open the cereal. Then 3 weeks later I actually found it on the recall list. Then they<br />listed it on their site. I inquired again and asked for a refund. Sent several emails and received no response.<br />They do not back their own products. They were apparently using crappy peanuts in there own cereal and did not even know the source of the peanuts. Can't trust them on any of there items. I never got a refund. This company cannot be trusted. Stay away.

Great taste, chewy, generous with nuts, natural ingredients, and the company has a wholesome and green attitude. Super! There is one significant caveat . . . they are very devious with the nutritional information, so beware!  The ""serving size"" is listed as 1/4 cup, enough to feed a small bird. I always mix this with Post Shredded Wheat/Wheat'n Bran (and use soy milk), probably the most nutritious and honest cereal out there. Perhaps the only cereal with no sugar or sweeteners (or salt). Tasty and plenty of fiber, too. And reasonably priced. If you are concerned with healthy eating, don't pass Post Shredded Wheat, Wheat n'Bran by. It has a nice crunch and taste, though mixing it with Bear Naked Fruit and Nut makes for a more roundly delicious meal. The Post Shredded Wheat/Wheat'n Bran lists a serving as 1 1/4 cups. Realistic. Compare that to Bear Naked's 1/4 cup and you will see that Bear Naked, despite its great taste, is extremely caloric. 1 1/4 cups of Bear Naked has 35g of fat, or 55% of the Daily Value and 700 calories! 1 1/4 cups of the Post cereal has 2% of the Daily Value and 200 calories.

No toy other then the black ""extreme chew"" Kong has stood the test of my dog Marley.

I figured the treat would keep her busy for while and the rubber felt fairly strong. Boy was I impressed! First though I have to mention that my dog has some unpleasant behavior with certain treat items (rawhides, beef bones, pigs ears) in that she has a drive to bury these things in what ever she can cover it with, which often tends to be bedding or under rugs. SO once I put the treat in the ball she was bound and determined to ""bury"" it in our apartment. The treat got nixed and I gave her just the ball. It has been her favorite toy for years! In fact she once lost it playing in her grandmas muddy yard on a rainy day, looked all over for it and gave up. She was devastated, kept searching for it at home, I was really surprised because she's never gotten attached to a toy like that before. I went out and hunted down a new one for her. Well about a year later while at her grandmas house I let her in from the yard and she's got TWO of these in her mouth the old one and the new one! Leave it to her to find it after all this time.

We initially did not crate him (mostly because members of my family have a phobia of cages) and as a result are out four pairs of shoes, two pairs of prescription glasses, a desk, a leather chair, a leather couch, two desk chairs, and portions of our walls and several door jambs. Needless to say, we crate him now, but while that saved our furniture (what was left of it), it didn't solve our dog's need for mental stimulation. We saw this at Petsmart (for about 10$ more than it is listed here) and figured we had nothing to lose. (As a side note, he does now go to daycare 3 days a week, which helps with his energy levels substantially.)<br /><br />Our dog loves it! Where soft, squeaky, or any other kind of toy lasts only a matter of minutes (though he never did like Kongs) almost 7 months in, and the dog has yet to destroy the blue rubber ball. We have gone through at least a dozen packages of the ""everlasting treats"" made by the same company, which last on average about two days each for him. When we're out of those, we find we can put moderately sized training treats or bits of his kibble in the middle area and he has a grand time rolling it around and bouncing it off walls to get them out. In the summer we also like to smear peanut butter on the inside and freeze it for ten or fifteen minutes before giving it to him.<br /><br />All in all, this was a great investment for us. So much so that we ended up purchasing a second one that we fill with alternate flavors of treats or keep in reserve.<br /><br />My only complaints are these: One of the balls is very easy to get the everlasting disks into (consequently, it's also relatively easy for my dog to get them out again), while the other is so stiff it takes a very long time to get a disk into at all. After all that effort, I feel like my hands are completely worn out. (Edit: I hadn't seen a few other users trick of getting the edges of the treat wet to make it easier to slide into the ball. I will have to try that next time around). Also, the ball is expensive upfront, but lasts long enough to be worth it. The treat disks are also expensive, though, so that's something I've had to work into my budget.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is a great toy for those dogs that need a toy that can stand up to them.

The postman brought the treat ball in the morning and the dog spent all afternoon playing with it. Because I was busy and the dog was happily occupied I failed to notice for quite a while that the Everlasting brand chicken treat that came with the toy was making nasty stains all over the beige wall-to-wall carpet in my office. I'm pretty sure my pup isn't any more slobbery than any other avidly chewing canine. But his slobber and the chicken treat combined to create a trail of ugly mustard-colored carpet stains all over the room. In addition to a bunch of spots all over the place, I found a few large stains in out-of-the-way places where my dog had settled for awhile to lick and chew away at the toy. The treat ball itself is just fine -- I have no complaints about it as a quality dog toy. But I have serious issues with the food coloring that's used in the Everlasting treats that pop into the ball. I've just used up an entire aerosol can of carpet cleaner and an hour of elbow grease to remove the stains from my carpet. After this experience I won't be buying any Everlasting brand treats to put in my pup's new chew toy. If you're going to be using this product outdoors, then the Everlast treats might be just fine. But if you're planning to let your dog play with this toy indoors, and you've got nice flooring that you care about keeping reasonably clean, it's best to avoid the Everlast treat inserts."

My dog is a more gentle pointer mix, so I thought I would still give it a try. I ordered it and have been extremely happy with it ever since! My dog is more of a ""licker"" than trying to chew or bite the treats off, so it lasts him at least an hour, and he absolutely loves it! He gets so excited when I bring it out for him to play with! I also love that you can buy a lot of great flavors. We started with the beef but they were so stinky and my dogs breath smelled awful, so we tried the mint ones and my dog loved them just the same AND his breath smelled better! The only downside is that my dog seems to have a little big of GI upset after chewing these in that his stool is a little softer. He also has a pretty sensitive GI tract in general, and my friend never reported her malamute having any issues so it's probably more of a ""my dog"" issue than with the treats themselves. I'm definitely happy with how the treat ball stands up to my dog's chewing and playing with it, and the one that belongs to my friend's malamute is still intact after years of use.

She told me he absolutely loved it and she had to take it away because he would be panting out of excitement from chewing on it. I went to my local Petco and picked up just the treats without the ball to see if he liked them and the rest of my afternoon was spent chasing my Rat Terrier/Sheltie mix around my apartment trying to get the treat back.  Needless to say he devoured it after about an hour or so. I picked up the whole kit for about 19.99 at Petco. It comes with the ball and one chicken treat insert. I have read MANY reviews saying how there dog destroyed the ball or removed the treat in minutes. I'm not really sure how that happened as my little guy has pulled up carpeting before and has yet to even make much of a dent in the treat, let alone the ball. At first he was actually so frustrated that he just looked at the ball and whined/barked at us to get it out for him. Eventually I just took the treat out of the ball, let him lick it and chew on it just for about 10 seconds to get a taste for it again, and then I put it back in the ball.  He hasn't quit now for 45 minutes. I stuck some little treats I had laying around in the other side but it seems he could care less.

Rogers,0,0,5,1334880000,Great Feeding Puzzle,"My adult dog was easily able to remove the included treat within a few minutes even when it was inserted backwards as another reviewer suggested, so I don't plan to buy refills. However, when I filled the toy with kibble, Regal and our Malinois foster puppy both had to work for a couple of hours to empty it. Neither of them damaged the toy so it seems to be pretty safe for them. However, as with any toy, I will continue to monitor them frequently to be sure they haven't managed to chew off a piece that could be ingested. The puppy still has most of her baby teeth so I don't know how the toy will fare with her in a couple of months when her mouth will resemble that of a crocodile, but Regal (a Bulldog/Siberian Husky mix) didn't faze the material and he is a dedicated chewer. I'd feel better about this toy if it were made in the United States rather than China but I believe it will be OK with restricted use. Regal gets all of his meals from food puzzles and this one adds some variety to the mix.<br /><br />I'm adding to this review because we have been using it for several months now. I raised the rating to 5 stars because it has been so useful and the dogs have not damaged it at all. The puppy mentioned above got all of her adult teeth but I was still able to put peanut butter in the toy to pacify her in the crate when she fussed. It kept her happy for a couple of hours and she was never able to bite off a piece of the material. We now have our own adult Malinois, Sizzle, and we use it with him as well. I put kibble in it and let him get his dinner that way when he needs to be crated. I bought another one so that I can give Regal and Sizzle their own. The new foster puppy is doing well without a peanut butter pacifier for now, but I won't hesitate to use it with her if necessary. I still suggest watching any dog carefully with a toy. They are all different, but so far our three serious chewers have safely enjoyed this toy for several months so I recommend it highly."

But eventually he got into it. He worked the treat out pretty quickly and ate it with gusto. So I moved on to treats on the inside (a little jerky and some liver biscotti); it doesn't take him long to get them out, but he sure enjoys it. He's also getting a kick out of playing with it and chewing on it even now that it's empty. So far it's holding up, but I worry about those little flaps for treat entry; I can't imagine they're long for this world with his obsessive chewing.

I tried flipping the treat over so it points in as suggested by other reviewers and that lasted another 5 minutes or so. Then I jammed it completely inside the ball. That bought me another 5 minutes. I eventually had to take the treat away because he was eating it too fast. It later affected his digestion in a less than pleasant way. The treat is kind of gross-- it smells bad and leaves significant residue on the floor, dog bed, etc. I'm sorry I wasted the money on buying two (ridiculously expensive) replacement treats before knowing what I was getting into. That said, the ball itself is good for other things. I find that stuffing treats, frozen fruit, etc. inside of it keeps my dog occupied for much longer than the treat itself did. He spends more time with this ball than with any of the Kong toys he has, even the Kong Genius ones. I've also started feeding him his kibble shoved inside the ball.

It fits just about every type of treat, and you can choose different ways of stuffing it. Our dog isn't a big chewer, so we haven't had the problems that others have had with this toy.<br /><br />A few notes on our experience:<br />- MOST IMPORTANT: The rawhide piece you see in the pictures came out right away, and became a chew-disk rather than part of the toy. We had to take it away so she wouldn't accidentally swallow it. (And there's another, sad review from someone whose dog choked on the rawhide and died - rawhide can be dangerous!!) I'd recommend supervising your dog the first time and seeing whether the rawhide comes out. Don't buy replacement rawhides until you're sure you need them.<br />- You can vary the challenge level by how tightly you allow the tabs to hold a treat. You can fill the inner section with kibble, or you can wedge a biscuit or hard treat into the tabs, or you could freeze soft stuff in there. There's no need to buy special treats to fit this toy - it'll work with whatever you have.<br />- Our dog likes to play with this ball even after the treats are out, throwing it to herself and chasing it around the house. We now give it to her (filled with treats) when we're going out as a way to reduce separation anxiety, and it almost always keeps her busy so she doesn't notice we're leaving.<br />- It's silicone plastic, so it's softer and quieter than hard rubber toys on wood floors.<br />- It cleans up very easily in the sink or dishwasher.<br />- Unlike the Kong or the Squirrel Buddy, it has big holes on two sides (the holes in the picture are on both top and bottom). So I'm not sure how much of a mess it would make with peanut butter or frozen soft treats - we haven't tried, because hard treats work fine for us.<br />- Doesn't fit a huge amount, so probably wouldn't work to feed your dog. Our dog takes about 15-20 minutes to get the treats out, then plays with it for a little while after that.<br /><br />Different dogs have different interests, but I completely recommend giving the Everlasting Treat Ball a try for your dog!"

When she first got the treat ball, she would bark and whine at it in frustration because she couldn't figure out how to get the treat after she licked it flat. She has her adult teeth now. It takes her a while but she can get the treat mostly eaten now; she hasn't figured out how to pop the treat out yet. That's a good thing! I gave a large one of these to a Lab friend who had it for all of 10 minutes before popping both treats out. For now this is still a great treat for my dog, but I don't leave it out unsupervised because our other dog gets jealous even though he doesn't really care to chew on it (he has never been a big chewer). So, I don't know if she would chew through the plastic if I left it out all the time like I've seen in some of the reviews."

I didn't think I'd find a toy that interested her that she couldn't destroy in seconds.  We're working on day three and still see only a little difference in how much is gone from the treat, and she LOVES it!<br /><br />I appreciate the advice of some of the reviews I've read here.  Make sure you err on the side of purchasing a larger, rather than a smaller, ball if you have a question about size.  We bought the large for Ellie.  I can see that a dog would be able to chew it to shreds if it were too small for them, because they could get their jaws wrapped around it easily.  I think part of the fun of the toy seems to be the challenge of getting a grip on it.<br /><br />I've liked a lot of the suggestions I've read here, including items to stuff in the middle, and putting the disks in upside down.<br /><br />The disks pop in easily if you put them on a hard surface, put the ball over them and press down, popping the disk in place.<br /><br />Today the ball rolled under the bed, all the way to the wall.  She crawled under the bed to get to it.  She is obsessed with this toy, and that makes us both happier, because this girl needs to chew and I'm tired of buying toys that she rips to shreds in seconds.<br /><br />I'm sold on this toy and will order more disks online.  They come right to my house that way.  Five stars, two thumbs up, and all that!!  Now I'm going to look at other Starmark products."

This treat ball with one of the treats in each side lasted her days with hours of nonstop chewing until I would have to take it away for a while.  She loves it and so do I!  I will say, once there is only a little rim of the treat left along the side you may want to go ahead and take it away because I let her have it past that point and she sorta tore up the rim a bit that holds the treats in because she was trying to get the last bit out.  I think it will still work just fine though for hours more entertainment for her.  Great product!! By the way, for people who say it is dangerous or got destroyed by their dog here are 2 points to consider:<br />1. you should never let your dog chew on any treat or bone like this without supervision<br />2. yes this is a tough product, but some strong chewers will just naturally destroy anything that comes their way no matter how durable it is and that is something you should know about your dog.

Toys that we have had for her entire life were suddenly being destroyed and stuff strewed across the house as if it were a warning to all other toys. She was destroying and swallowing 3-4 inch pieces of rope, curtain ties, everything! So it is with desperation that I went to my local pet store in an attempt to find anything destructible. From previous experience, I knew she didn't like Kongs and I couldn't bring myself to purchase anything that was merely a used tire marked to up a pet-toy price. With that, I found this toy and another ""indestructible"" chew toy. While the other toy is good, nothing holds her interest like this product. It has drastically improved her behavior while crated and all other toys have been spared a painful death.<br /><br />The only downside is that the product doesn't smell the best. As she is always playing with it, that means it is always near us. We have tried instituting a ""no toys on the couch"" policy but its hard to enforce."

In fact, the only time he seems to be happy is if he's chewing on/ingesting something tasty. He goes through 9-inch compressed rawhides in a day and at $4-$6 a pop that gets pricey. He's got kongs and rollable treat balls but as soon as the food is gone he loses interest (naturally) and if he can't get the treats out easily enough, he gets bored and gives up.<br /><br />The Everlasting Treat Ball, however, is an entirely new ballgame! We had a rough start with it at first. He had the chicken ones that came with the ball and they really upset his stomach. If anyone knows about Bulldogs and their GI ""issues"" then you know that when their stomachs are upset, the entire house is miserable, if you catch my drift! (pun intended).<br /><br />Another issue we had the first time around was that he was able to get the second treat out within a few minutes (but not the first one it came with). That led me to believe that we weren't putting it in correctly, but no matter what we did, the end result was the same. So we gave up.<br /><br />On a whim I bought him some liver-flavored refills the other day and it's been almost 3 days and he's STILL working on the first one! It's a godsend! He'll leave it alone and come back to it a few hours later then spend another good hour or so with it. The best part about it (for us at least) is that there isn't any belly upset this time around! I paid around $8 for a refill of 2 and the first one alone has already lasted longer than a $5 rawhide...AND we don't have to dig slimy pieces out of his throat after he tries to swallows them.

She's about 40 pounds and I'd consider her a moderate chewer. She's not really destructive, but if she wants something bad enough, she makes it hers. We affectionately call this her ""puppy crack dispenser"". She brings it to us to fill up when she's finished the discs and she's PUSHY about it. To say she's addicted is putting it mildly. It keeps her attention for an hour or so at a time, which is a godsend. Right there, it makes this purchase worth it for us. As a matter of fact, we've just bought our second one. Which brings me to the bad...<br /><br />In no way is this an everlasting sort of toy, not in the ball part and not in the disc part. The first one we got her lasted for about 3 months of HARD use which really isn't bad considering the abuse it's gone through. We've replaced it now that little bits of blue plastic have started coming off and now that she can pry the discs out way too easily. Just as it started to get easier to put them in, due to use, it meant it took her WAY less time to get them out. The refills are just too expensive for three hours of entertainment when it would take her a couple of days to pry them free when the ball is new.<br /><br />Also, the slits in the middle to insert smaller treats open too wide to make it much of a challenge for my girl to empty it, so we skip that part.<br /><br />Overall, the fact we've replaced this toy when it started to wear speaks volumes.

If I put the ball with 2 treats in it in front of him, I know he is going to be busy for the next 2-3 hours just licking it. And if the ball is empty, he constantly drags the empty ball around the house to chew on...I think he's subtly hinting at me to get him more treats for it. He's not exactly mister super powerchew, but he can tear a wayward shoe up if one gets left of the floor. So having something to redirect his attention without the noise/danger of a nylabone (or the weird gross chips off an antler chew) is just fantastic.<br /><br />So far the vanilla mint and BBQ flavored treats are his all-time faves. The vanilla mint especially. I tried the liver treats and they smelled awful and he didn't seem as interested in them.<br /><br />There has been minimal staining. But we have mostly hardwood and he can't get on the large furniture fixtures 'cause of those little corgi legs. The few times there has been anything left over from the treat on a blanket/comforter, it's washed right out. And even then it was less of a stain and more of a smell.<br /><br />My friend has an older cocker spaniel who constantly futzes around the house. I told her to try these treats, and she was like, ""No, nothing ever works and they're pretty expensive."" So one day I brought her an everlasting treat to try. (My dog was obviously mad at me for dipping into his stash, but oh well.) Now, her dog is missing most of its teeth due to age, so I figured just the treat would be enough to occupy her. Aaaand sure enough, I was right. Dogs go crazy for these things if they're food motivated! My friend is totally going to buy a stock of these treats as well.<br /><br />The only, ONLY real downside to this is that one day my dog managed to pop the vanilla treat out and with his chewing it was gone in like 20 seconds. He's also got a sensitive stomach so his stomach was upset for a couple of days afterward. However! It's totally not the treat's fault my dog has stomach issues. I just think the ball could do with more suction to hold the treats in a little better. But that's the only time it happened. Like everyone else says, BUY A SIZE LARGER. I read the reviews here FIRST and then bought the large size for my corgi and it's worked out great.<br /><br />I see a lot of complaints here but the thing about buying ANYTHING for your dog, whether it be a treat, a brush, shampoo, etc. You have to KNOW your dog. If you know your dog can chew through a table-leg, it's probably going to be able to tear up the foam of this ball. If you KNOW your dog is NOT food motivated, then it's probably not going to be interested in what is essentially a giant flavored treat for more than 5 minutes.<br /><br />As for me? I'm 100% satisfied. I just wish the treats cost a little less so I could keep them around the house more."

He primarily licks his paws and he also has a slightly elongated soft palette so he often just licks the air if you will. He has a history of stress colitis and overall a very sensitive digestive system. So, I was given the task of trying to find him enrichment that was food incentivized (as he loves food/treats) but wouldn't hurt his digestive track.<br /><br />So, I ordered this ball and it arrived today. He's totally into it! We're hoping that because he can't really break down the treat inside the ball he'll just sit and lick and keep him pre-occupied. He's been at it an hour and so far hasn't made a dent, he's growling at it which is kind of entertaining. The ball came with two chicken treats included which I didn't realize so I ordered the digestive sensitive ones too. I am going to try the chicken to see how he reacts to it.<br /><br />I'll update my review in a few days ending overnight results. So far, it's a total hit! Also, I ordered the medium, when I opened the package I was kind of scared because it seemed large but watching him try and eat it makes me realize that it's the perfect size. Anything bigger or smaller wouldn't work. I hope this review helps, I think it's a great toy!<br /><br />UPDATE: We had no problems overnight or this morning. He's still working on the one from yesterday. His stomach doesn't seem upset and we slept through the night without constant licking! I think this will be my new gift for the holidays to family!

I'd rate it a 3 for one and a 5 for the other, so I've given it a 4 overall.  For one of my dogs, it's quite the challenge to get treats out of the center and he'll spend hours licking the outside ""caps"" if I put them on. And, even when he's done with the caps, he'll still lick the ball part getting every last scent of food off of it. For him, it is the perfct toy that amuses him for hours. For my other dog, she can literally pop the caps off and eat them in minutes. Inside treats take her a few more minutes to pop out. She's 15 lbs of pure chewing power with jaws of steel. Of the two of these balls that I own, one is starting to tear a bit in the center from her biting down to allow the treats to fall out.  Even though she can get the treats out and eat them quickly, I'm still rating it a 3 because she likes to play with the ball even when it's empty. Because it has flat sides, she can bounce it and it will roll, but usually stops before it goes under couches etc that will cause me to have to climb under the furniture to retrieve the toy for her. (That's always a plus!)The treats that the manufacturer sells to accompany this toy are rather pricey, so I will often substitute my own, more cost-efficient treats or dog-safe veggies/fruits. In short, I'd recommend this, but it's not a miracle toy that will stimulate every dog and dogs that do chew it a lot should be supervised for safety."

We sprayed our furniture with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EI1BRO"">NaturVet Bitter Yuck No Chew Spray</a> to make it taste bad and redirected his chewing tendencies towards this toy.  As you can see, he loves the toy and although he is NOT a food-motivated dog, it combined with the Bitter Yuck to stop him from destroying property.<br /><br />As per other reviews, the treat is indeed difficult for my hands to stuff into the toy (my fiance did it in the end). Tock has been trying to get the treat out for about a week and not yet succeeded.  The way he manipulates the toy simulates how he would gnaw marrow out of a bone, engaging his paws as well as his jaws.

Don't even get me started on toys that have stuffing.  Within the last two weeks, I've started allowing them to be uncrated in my house without me there.  Previously, they were completely untrustworthy, but I feel really guilty crating them while I'm at work.  And I thought they were acting more grown up.  Not chewing my stuff, just theirs.  So, I came home one day to find a highlighter destroyed (on carpeting, of course).  The next day the victim was one of their dog beds that they'd always left alone.  So, out of desperation I tried this product (and paid way more than the price at Amazon at a local pet store).  These things are AWESOME.  They keep their attention for hours and a treat lasts for about 2 days.  My one dog loves hers so much that she's like obsessed with it.

She's about 25 pounds, active, but won't play with any toys, and can get down a rawhide in ten minutes.  I wanted to find something to cut into her boredom and downtime, but not add a lot of calories.<br /><br />The first day I put it together (took about one minute) and rolled it across the floor.  She slowly took after it, investigated, and I went to make dinner.  I enjoyed my first dinner at home in about a year that didn't involve my dog staring at me hoping for a handout.  She just obsessed over the ball, licking it, and grinding at it with her teeth.  After dinner I checked it, and she had made what appeared to be almost negligible progress on the treat.  We watched a movie in peace (other than this constant weird panting/slurping noise from the other room).  At some point, we realized she had been working on this thing for about three hours.  My wife checked her mouth, she was afraid her gums would be bleeding or that her teeth would be ground down to the gums.  But no sign of damage.  We took it away from her and put it on top of the fridge, and she sat there staring up at the fridge for about half an hour.<br /><br />I'm now on my third day, about three hours a day, still working on the first two discs that fit on opposite sides of the ball.  I think maybe she's gotten through about half of it.  She's actually penetrated one of the discs with a hole that goes all the way through.  She's obsessed.  While she has it, she doesn't want to do anything else.  If I go to pet her (which she normally loves) she treats me as an irritant keeping her from her ball.  Want to walk (normally her favorite thing)?  Nope.  Maybe after I'm done with this ball in another 16 hours I'll walk.  I wonder how long she would be on this ball if I let her?  Her jaws must be cramping up.  I get the feeling I could give it to her, go to bed, and wake up to see her with bloodshot eyes still working on the ball.  It's like crystal meth for dogs.<br /><br />Oh my god, while I'm writing this my dog accidentally rolled the ball under a table and she can't get to it.  She looks like an alcoholic staring at a drink they can't reach.  I actually feel sorry for her.

I hesitated in purchasing this item because of the price (I'm obviously tired of brands not living up to their description) but I am very happy to say that my dog worked well over 4 hours before the treats were gone.  He loved the taste of them and due to the design, they were challenging for him to get out so he really had to work on it.  Another thing I liked was the fact that the ball itself isn't hard, but feels gel-like and that is appealing to him.  This is by far one of the best things I've bought for him and I highly recommend it to anyone who has a dog that loves to chew!<br />UPDATE: Still a challenge for my dog after many months...he has figured out how to pop out the treat but I now insert it upside down so that the treat is concave instead of convex and that has worked very well."

IMO, order the largest size your dog can have fun with.  I exchanged the small for a medium and it's worked out great. This way, he can't get his jaws around it and he can't pop the treats out-he just licks it to death, rolls it everywhere and growls at it b/c he can't get to the treats-which is the whole point of the toy.

It's easy to kiss 10 dollar toys good bye in less than 10 minutes.<br /><br /> I have had the product for about a month and it is by far Loki's favorite toy, even without treats.  I have played tug of war, fetch, and other dog favorite games; the ball-like object is in perfect condition still.  He will carry the toy about the house in his mouth, very regal and proud looking, as if he's King In The Castle.<br /><br />Some dog toys over time will gain a very bad odor.  After a month of constant use, this thing does not give off an odor that I can tell.  I won't put my nose or mouth near it, but from a couple of feet away, it still seems to smell like new.  If this ever gains an odor of some sort, I will probably resort to washing it and then adding some vanilla extract to the water to give it a humanly pleasant flavor.  I have done this for other toys and Loki seems to have a renewed interest in them.<br /><br />I have not allowed him to take the toy outside as we have several feet of snow and that would just be begging to be lost.  Based on the design, this thing will be a dirt magnet on the inside, especially since my backyard is in quasi-woods with zero grass.<br /><br />The treats that came with it seemed to be enjoyable for Loki.  It took him about an hour and a half to eat.  He didn't figure out how to pop them out as some people have stated.  He just gnawed and licked it the whole time.  The treats are a bit expensive, as I can buy raw hides or real bones for less.<br /><br />Peanut butter is your friend.  Smear some on the inside and Loki goes crazy trying to lick and clear it.  You can break up dog treats or put dog food in it and it will slow them down.  Loki has become an expert at getting them out, removing them in less than a minute.<br /><br />With all of that said and done, I would highly recommend this treat to anyone who has a dog that can truly chew.

The ball itself, however, has turned out to be Cookie-proof.  Months after the purchase, she still plays with it.  It bounces nicely, and doesn't roll under the furniture as much as other balls.  I've also found that if I stuff it with her regular treats (small bits of chicken jerky) or her kibble, it does keep her occupied for a while.  Although she chews on it, I can find very little evidence of toothmarks, so whatever this is made of is pretty strong.

Maybe she was just lucky is what I thought, so I put the treat back in the ball and went to the bathroom to wash my hands and came back in under a minute or two and the treat was out yet again.

I think this is the secret - if she had a small she would be _too_ successful, and that would take the challenge out of it.<br /><br />I've had this for over a year, and it has sustained pretty much no damage, although shoes, electronics, socks and other items around our house had been completely destroyed before its arrival.

During the first four months that we had them, these two literally chewed holes in my kitchen walls (yes,walls!!!) and rounded the corners of all of my cabinets. That's the thanks I got for penning them in the kitchen while we were in bed or at work. No toy had ever survived more than an hour, especially with the minpin. The Everlasting Treat Ball helped to turn that all that around. We bought all three sizes and they play with them all. They both love the treats that are marketed to go with the toy, but the minpin pops them out way too easily (even the large ones), so I usually just stick with filling the inside with carrot pieces, dog cookies, or even just a handful of their regular food. It keeps them busy for hours of destruction-free chewing. If I really need them to be good for a while, I smear a little peanut butter in it. I pop the toys in the dishwasher once a week with no ill effects. The only real negative that I can say is that they are pretty expensive and hard to find in the pet stores.  Also, I don't bother with the (expensive) plug-in cookies that they sell unless I know that the papillion is the only one that will be working on it (she's a much lighter chewer than the minpin).

We initially bought the medium for our Presa Canario (Bella) when she was a puppy. She had a great time nibbling and trying to get the treat out but was unable to. We lost the toy and a couple months.  Later when we found it, our puppy had grown considerably and could easily pop the treats out and attempt to swallow them whole.  As a result, we decided the toy was too small for her and gave it to our Norwegian Elkhound (Nikki) who also loved it.  It took her several hours but she was also able to pop the treats out but being a mature dog knew better than to try to swallow them whole.<br /><br />Later, we decided to buy the large one for Bella and she absolutely had a blast with it.  After hours she would be able to pop the treat out but we pop it back in and she would have to work at it some more.<br /><br />I would say this is a great toy for dogs that need stimulation and like to chew and rip things up.  Although the treat can be popped out by both of our dogs the ball itself has survived several refills and weeks of play.  This is not a toy i would leave the dog unattended with.  If you do leave them unattended they will probably pop the treat out and eat it the first day you get it.  Keep an eye on them and be there to grab the treat and pop it back in and they will get hours of focused play with this toy.<br /><br />It is much more difficult to get the treats out of the large toy so even if you have a smaller dog it is a good idea to go ahead and get the larger version. Bella and Nikki definitely would recommend this toy. They both love it.<br /><br />One small downside other than the treats popping out, the dogs do quite a bit of drooling with this toy.  In the case of Bella, we had to establish that it was a toy she could only have while in the kitchen so that she wouldn't drool all over the living room carpet.<br /><br />In addition, the replacement treats are a bit expensive considering the amount of time they take the dog to consume. In short, i gave this 4 stars because although your dog is virtually guaranteed to have a great time with it, it's not every day toy."

I am glad I did...my dog loves this thing.  He was able to get the caps that came with it out quickly, but when I bought replacements they looked to be a little different texture and he has not popped these out yet.  He also loves it when I put treats inside for him to chew out which I do without using the caps.<br /><br />I did have an issue after about a month when I purchased the new caps.  Since he was not able to pop the caps out (which he shouldn't be able to do), he was chewing constantly and did cause a couple of scissor like cuts in the rubber with his teeth.  It's not bad, but it could result in rubber chunks coming off.  I wasn't sure if anything could be done, but I contacted the customer service of the company that makes this and they were extremely helpful.  They replied to my email same day (that never happens!) and they did say that they have had a few cases where this has occured in the rounded edge of the ball.  They also said they were sending me their everlasting fun ball free of charge as that type of toy might work better.  Wow!  That's customer service."

She was able to pop the treats out very quickly, and unlike one of the other reviewers, they don't really last. She chewed them up very quickly.  I wish I would have gotten a bigger size, one so the little everlasting treat would last longer, and two so that I could put more loose treats inside, and three in the hopes that she has a harder time biting down on the treat (which pops the sides out).<br /><br />All in all, I think the rubber is high quality grade, but nothing beats a Kong when it comes to price and the number of ways you can stuff it to make a treat last!"

Great for when we have guests or want to sit down and watch a movie. I love it, love it, love it!!! It is important to get the right size. I use the small on my 8lb dog and the medium on my 14 lb terrier and 17 lb mini aussie.

Like the above reviewer, my dogs couldn't deal with the treat that covers one end of the ball.  They licked it a few times, pushed the ball around a few times, and that was it.  They could not figure out how to get out the little treats inside, because there are flaps covering the opening, which you bend to pop in the little treats.  These flaps keep the little treats from falling out when the ball moves, but they were just thick enough so that my dogs couldn't figure out how to push them aside to get at the treats.<br /><br />In all fairness, my dogs are chihuahuas--the biggest is about 7 pounds -- and a larger dog may very well have more fun with this.

By the time I had gotten home, he had already popped one of the caps off and chewed it up, so I took that one away and popped the third cap on, and gave it back to him, and both caps were off and eaten within probably fifteen minutes of being at home.  I am completely unimpressed, I spent over $16 on these treats and the ball, and the Everlasting Treat ball was useless in a matter of minutes.

Since the ball itself seems pretty flimsy I then took the balls away so they wouldn't destroy those too.  The treats give off a nauseating smell as the dogs are chewing them as well, to the point I had to turn on a fan, and even left the room.

After the treat was consumed, they got to work on the ball itself...it's a great item for my dachshunds, but for the Aussies and the German Shepherd, it's hardly ""Everlasting"". Darn it!

Fill the center with normal kibble or treats, insert an Everlasting Treat in each side and let the fun start.  Even my large, heavy chewer dogs take 2 days to get past even one of the treats.  This helps keep them busy, and allows them to work for the food in the center.  Overall, my dogs give this product 4 paws up!  (Laying on their backs of course)"

My dogs love these, but must be watched closely so the heavy chomper doesn't steal it and destroy it.  I wish he understood that he used to have one, but he ruined it.  I bet a Border Collie would have figured that out, but then again, a Border Collie would have logged on and bought another."

My powerful American Bulldog/pit mix popped the Everlasting treats out and consumed them in no time, so I originally chalked this toy up as a failure.  But then I realized I could put regular treats inside it, and, used in that manner, it excels.<br /><br />I've gone through several different treat-dispensing toys, trying to find one that both held up to my tough dogs' determined chewing, and also delivered the treats at just the right ""not-too-fast, not-too-slow"" rate.  Most of the toys I've tried deliver the treats too quickly, which defeats the purpose of keeping a 'home alone' dog occupied for hours.  The Buster Cube delivers treats at a nice rate, but the hard plastic construction makes it so incredibly loud that the noise not only makes it less enjoyable for the dog that's using it, but it also agitates my other dogs that have to listen to it.  This toy is very quiet, and VERY durable.  My dog is a powerful, determined chewer (he once ate a hard plastic floor tray designed to set dog bowls on)and he has been using this toy daily for months, and it shows very little wear.  I fill it about 1/3 full with the low calorie Trader Joe's dog treats, and it keeps my boy happy and focused for hours.<br /><br />So, if your dog is a determined chewer, skip the Everlasting treats and just buy the ball and use it for your own treats.  I guess the only challenge might be finding treats that are just the right size, if you don't have access to the Trader Joe's treats, but I'm sure Petsmart and Petco carry something that will work.  A treat that is about dime-sized works great. Something the size of dog food kibble would fall out too quickly, but it could be used to deliver a meal to a dog that tends to eat too fast.<br /><br />It might not be apparent from the photo, but the x-shaped treat-dispensing slots are inset from the outer edge of the ball quite a bit, making it very difficult for the dog to chew on that portion of the ball directly, which, along with the material the ball is made of, contributes a lot to its durability.<br /><br />Here's a link to the treats I use in this ball:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002XAFTG"">Trader Joe's Charlee Bear Treats</a><br /><br />www.amazon.com/Charlee-Bear-Treat-16-Ounce-Liver/dp/B0002XAFTG/ref=sr_1_cc_1"

Within 15 minutes of her having it the ball was in pieces all over the floor and she had taken out both treat discs. There was $20+ down the drain.<br /><br />The ball and the treats are Made in China - the treats are rock hard, the main ingredient is wheat and I suspect it is closer to some sort of wheat gluten glue that hardens - when  wet it does smell a bit and does leave a mess on the carpet. The ball is a jelly plastic that has a strange odor - I had a really hard time getting the treats into the ball so not surprised that the one dog couldn't get them back out. But if your dog can figure it out, or gets frustrated quickly you'll be surprised at how fast that ball will be torn to pieces when the dog turns its chewing jaws from the treat to the ball. Have no idea what the ball is made of and if it is toxic or not so had take it away (and throw it away) before they had a chance to eat any of it by accident.<br /><br />So -<br />Pro: could potentially last your dog a long time and keep him occupied<br /><br />Cons: expensive, Made in China, wheat based treats (allergy alert) and not going to last long if you have a determined dog.<br /><br />Kongs are the only toys my dogs have never been able to tear apart, they are the only things that have survived from puppyhood to now grown, adult dogs."

So, I don't know how all these other dogs have managed to destroy their toy or retrieve their treat so fast. As another reviewer stated, I believe the treat ball would probably be best for the ""dumb"" dogs and the Bento ball for the ""smart"" chewers.  But, now at the 3.5 hour mark, my bulldog has tired himself out from chewing on the ball and it is sitting in front of him with noticable marks on the treat surface, but the blue ball still looks brand new (well, with a little slobber on it.)<br /><br />I would highly recommend this toy for your power chewing dogs!"

He sniffed the toy and treat and then walked away and it hasn't been touched since. I think what's turning him off is the smell of the plastic ball itself. It has a VERY strong fake-vanilla scent to it which is unpleasant to humans but must be overwhelmingly gross to a dog. By the way, my dog is not at all picky. He will play with anything and eat anything so this is a real first!<br /><br />Also, I looked at the ingredients for the treat and it's all absolute junk.

If you have two or more dogs (we have a lab mix--loves to chew--and a french bulldog teething puppy),  I recommend getting all of yours in the larger size, so you don't have to keep track of who is chewing which one.

She chewed a huge hole in my kitchen floor, all the way thru to the crawlspace, then proceeded to chew thru the back door (yep you guessed it... she succeeded).  Anyway, stuffed toys are a joke to her.  They last all of 2 minutes, no matter how ""tuff"" they claim to be.  She generally has no interest in the rubber ""Kong"" types, so I was skeptical about this Everlasting Toy.  Boy was I wrong.  She is completely addicted. She carries it everywhere.  The disk treat inside lasted about a day.  She had more fun licking it than trying to get it out of the toy.  She finally licked it down so far that it pretty much came out on it's own.  I stuffed little treats in the other side.  She could not put it down.  After going at it a full day, she finally got it empty.  I inspected it at that point.  Not a single puncture or tear.  This thing is amazing.  It was a little pricey at Petsmart.  I'll get the refills here.  Definately worth the $$.  She's about 18 lbs, so I got the medium size.  Perfect fit.<br />*** CON:  The Chicken flavor disks do smell a little yucky.  And, after awhile of constant licking, they also get a little slimey.  I would suggest keeping it off the furniture."

I fill the other side with some of her daily kibble and she'll roll it around and get her kibble out.  I've put in other treats and she'll go after them too.  The flaps are rather thick, which makes it hard for the treats to come out.  Good for keeping the interest, but not so good for younger dogs that lose interest quickly.  She would have ignored this a month or two ago, at 8 months she can play with it longer.  I put in easy things to get out now, I'll make it harder in a week or two.

First you can use it with the included treat caps.  Put one in and your dog will lick it and enjoy it for hours. Be sure you purchase the right size treat ball for your dog - buy one too small and the dog will be able to pop the treat out and chew it up in no time.  Purchase the right size and it will be impossible to remove the treat cap, which is exactly how the toy is supposed to work.<br /><br />Another way to use the cap is to fill it with EveryFlavor Treats (sold separately) by the same company. These are small, soft treats, in many different flavors, that spill out slowly while the ball is played with.  Again, the idea is that the treats are metered out slowly.<br /><br />You can also feed your pet his or her daily kibble in it if it's of small enough gauge.  If you need to, you can clip back the rubber on the ball to make it easier.<br /><br />You can also fill it with a mix of kibble and peanut butter for a double treat.<br /><br />We have these in all three sizes because we have pup's that fit all three.  We have to keep the pets separated while they have them or the Brittany heads straight for this one because he can pull the cap out in about 10 seconds and then chew it up and swallow it in about 2 minutes - a tasty treat which we try to keep him from enjoying!<br /><br />Disclaimer:  We sell this product in our store and it's one of our best-sellers but we use it on a daily basis and have since they started making them.

I was so impressed I bought a larger version for my 18lb Bichon/Coton mix.  He loves his too! He's a pretty good chewer although his teeth aren't very sharp. We even bought one for our friends' dog, a 14 lb dachshund who can destroy anything.  He loves it so much his parents call it his ""precious"".  And, so far he has not destroyed it!  I would just caution that even though these may keep your dog occupied, you should still supervise him/her in case they do get the treat out (I always just put it back in) or if they manage to pull hunks of plastic off.

From the description of this product, I thought the rubber that the ball is made of would be a little more durable than it is.  The replaceable treats, however, last an incredibly long time.  My dogs were totally obsessed with this toy.  My only recommendation is to monitor your dog with this toy and check for signs of wear. Had I replaced the treats sooner (before they had worn down and were difficult for the dogs to get to), I think that my treat balls would have lasted a lot longer.  I recommend this product only with supervision, as my dogs are only around six pounds each and chewed pieces off sooner than I thought they could."

When she had a broken leg and was on bed rest for months this toy really helped out and would occupy her for days.

I have another that has the treat out in 5 minutes and has the little treats out in about an hour (he then waits for the other dog to give up, then finishes that off too).  The blue silicone part is the toy they have had the longest and seems to still be lasting.  I have had it over 6 months.  I have the red fire hydrant one also and it is almost torn up and I have had it less time than this.

The smell of the flavor cap was horrible, made me almost vomit but my dog loves it. Then we noticed our dog wasn't feeling so well. She had excessive gas that was room clearing. I looked up what could be causing this and most say its due to a diet change or low quality food being feed to the dog. I saw all kinds of remedy suggestions from rice and veggies to pepto.

So I order the large treat ball (which is surprisingly huge). I could barely force the treats into the giant treat ball, but that is good, because neither of my dogs can get the treats out now. Instead it keeps my corgi occupied for ages, and when he has to go in his crate I toss it in there to keep him busy. He loves it. My shiba is not quite as interested in it, but that is just her nature. It was a bit expensive but worth it to keep the puppy busy."

When they see me pull out their blue ball, they get so excited because they know what's coming! They are both around 26 pounds and STRONG chewers. At first I bought the medium size balls but found that they were able to pop the treats out in about 1/2-1 hour. So, I switched to the large size and now they can't get the treat out and it takes them a LONG time to lick and chew on it until its finished. They cant pop the treat out until its almost completely finished. Thus,I would only recommend the large size for any dog over 20 pounds. These are great when you need to keep them occupied for an extended period."

Our other dog who his a 70 lb shepard and who doesn't normally like chew type treats or toys also like it so much that we bought her one as well.  We purchased these about a year ago and they like them a much today as they did then.  We have also learned that the vanilla mint treats are by far the favorite.

He made quick work of the ""everlasting"" treat hunk once it was released from the ball and would repeatedly pop it back out if I reloaded it.  I now use this to just stuff regular treats inside of and it is mediocre.  Definitely not the best or longest lasting treat toy I've found.  For the price, it's just not worth it AT ALL.<br /><br />Perhaps smaller dogs or dogs that are less prone to chewing would get more long lasting enjoyment out of this.  It is more like the ""10 minute treat crunching bonanza"" for my boy than everlasting.<br /><br />The Premier Busy Buddy treat dispensing toys (particularly this: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KV7ZGQ"">Premier Busy Buddy Tug-A-Jug, Medium/Large</a>) are more durable, offer more options for filling, and are more difficult/entertaining for the dog...and also much cheaper!

We ordered 2 and purchased extra discs because we thought that our dogs would surely go through the discs like they go through other treats.  Well, as soon as we got the ball we decided to try it out. We put their favorite sirloin flavored treats inside the bottom of the ball and put a disc on the top side.  We left for dinner and a movie and when we came home we were afraid at what we might find.  To our surprise and delight, they were still busy working on the ball!!  While they were able to get the sirloin treat out they were trying to destroy the disc instead of our stuff!! We have used about 3 discs in 3 weeks so they last a long time.  This works like a charm.  Each time we have to leave the house to go shopping, visit a friend, or go out on a date we leave them with the everlasting treat ball and they are entertained.

Not in a ""dressed in pink, riding around in my shopping cart spoiled."" Just loved and adored every day.<br /><br />Crockett does not play with rubber chew toys and is not allowed to have rawhide (for health and safety). He has figured out every treat-dispensing toy (of about 15) that we own. They only take him minutes to conquer. However, this everlasting treat ball is a constant challenge. The challenge is not in the replaceable treat ""caps."" The challenge is between the inner, triangular flaps in the center.<br /><br />The first time that we gave him this toy, we only put one treat cap (official ""Everlasting"" treat) on one end - you can put one on each end if you prefer. It took him about 20 minutes to devour - a record for any treat-dispenser. Pretty soon he taught us that he could now get those suckers out in 3-5 minutes. However, we raised the bar and started putting his standard treats between the flaps in the middle. It takes us and him a little work (we have to pry the flaps back with our fingers and poke the largest bits possible inside). It is worth it to watch him contentedly gnaw at this toy for up to 30 minutes. Changing the inside treat is the trick because each type takes a little different tactic - cookie-like treats require the lick-it-raw approach, hard, meatish treats need some good crunching, and dried, real meat (think jerky) requires just the right angle.<br /><br />In fairness, Crockett is not a chewing kind of dog. If it's not food, he won't put his teeth on it. So, the first day that he carried this into the kitchen in his mouth when I came home from work, I almost collapsed in surprise. (The rubber that this treat ball is made from is softer than most pet toys and seems more appealing to Crockett.)<br /><br />Stats: Crockett is a pitbull/kelpie mix and weighs about 40 lbs. He works well with the med-sized ball, but isn't a crazy-chewer by nature. He is good with his paws and will hold a toy in different ways to get it ""just right."" He eats like a cat (when he's hungry), but likes all kinds of food.<br /><br />Crockett and I both hope that this helps you choose well for your pet!"

I give it 4 stars though because it costs a lot and the treats come out too easily.

I recently broke down and bought one of these toys and she loves it as well!  I've limited her to one treat every two weeks, since they are not cheap and I don't know the caloric density of these treats and like to keep her weight well regulated.  In the between times, I place treats/kibble inside the ball and she flings it around the apartment to get them out.  I've had to take the Everlasting Treat Ball away from her on occasion because she WILL NOT STOP eating the treat and starts to get frustrated that she CAN'T GET IT OUT!  She has popped out the treats occasionally but only after several hours of chewing and licking it beforehand.  It's nice to have something I can give her that will keep her occupied.<br /><br />TIP: Make sure you get the right size!  Otherwise, it will be more likely that your dog can pop the treats out.  I bought Cora a LARGE.<br /><br />TIP: Put the treats in upside-down!  This trick was mentioned by someone else who commented, and it definitely works for my dog.  It is a lot more difficult for her to pop out the treat if the convex side is toward the center of the ball and the flat surface is exposed.  She does get a bit more frustrated with the toy if I do this though, so I have to watch her more carefully to make sure she's not chewing up the toy just the get the treat!<br /><br />TIP: I tried the fire hydrant version of this toy first, but Cora chewed the edges off around the treat in order to get it out faster.  So... it died.  This one is much more durable since it doesn't have the same sort of ""lip"" around the edge."

SIGH. OK, so you've got an idea what my dog is like onto my review.<br />So I've seen these things both online and at pet stores, and always felt a little unsure about these things. For one thing, these things aren't cheap and two like I've described I've got a really smart Lab. So I broke down and bought this at the pet store after a worker I spoke with highly recommended it. Yes, this was even after I told him about my pup. He said he's got a big dog too who's a ""chewer."" Kobe usually knows when I've bought him something. Soon as I got home, I had to test it out. After 10 mins, not a dent so I was pretty amazed so far. 20 mins later, I see he managed to get that treat out!?!? Sigh...so I pried it out of his mouth and put that slobbery thing back in the ball. Next thing, he had it out again and this time he chewed a good chunk of it so it no longer fit. So I put it in the inner part of the ball and minutes later he got it out of there too. S-I-G-H.<br />I take off 1 star because in my case it was everlasting. I do give it credit for being pretty durable and the treat took a little while longer for him to eat. Also, it's got a cave you can bury treats in which isn't as easy for them to get things out of. I say it's OK."

It took him an entire week of daily, constant chewing to just get through one of these cookies and when he did, he was very excited and pleased with himself!  Once he finished that one cookie, he went on the attack the second one.  I also put treats inside the ball, under the cookies and my dog loves trying to get through one cookie just to get to the treats inside.

In all fairness the treats are very dense so she didn't gobble it up immediately, but it didn't last over 20 minutes.  I put one of the treats in and she immediately grabbed the end that sticks out and pulled it out and began to eat the treat within 5-10 minutes.  I think the treats should be more low-profile so they can't just be pulled out like a human would.  Also, with just one treat in my dog figured out she could just stick her snout in the opposite end the the treat would pop out the other side again.  I took the treat away when it got flat like a disk and stuck it in the middle compartment (where you're supposed to put tiny treats) and she got that out too.<br /><br />SUMMARY: 3 stars because the treats are dense and using tiny treats in the middle alone might make the toy more functional, but the big treats are too expensive and weren't difficult enough to entertain my dog for longer than a rawhide."

At their peak they had 57 retail shops or parlors. The stores not only sold candy, fudge toppings, and baked goods, but also had fountain counters serving light lunches, as well as an assortment of desserts including the popular Ice Cream Sodas, Sundaes and Hot Fudge Cream Puffs. I have lived in the metro Detroit area all my life and getting a Creme Puff Hot Fudge Sunday was a weekly occurrence in my family. Unfortunately the company wound up closing all of their stores back in the early 90's and concentrated on selling their products in regular nationwide grocery stores. Sanders was purchased by Morley Candies, another Metro Detroit company, back in 2002 and thankfully they have started to bring back the Sanders Parlors. As of this writing there are now 6 locations, including 2 that are less than 10 minutes from my house. I cant even begin to express how happy I am to see these stores being opened again. If your ever in the Metro Detroit area and have a chance to stop by one of their retail locations, do it!! It will be the best Hot Fudge Sunday you have ever had.<br /><br />If you do not live in the Metro Detroit area then dont fret. You can still buy their topping in jars and can even buy the creme puffs from their online website. In fact you can now order all of their products from their website. I recently placed an order for some sea salt caramels from their website and was absolutely blown away at the quality of the shipping. I ordered 2 boxes of caramels and a bag of creme puffs and when I received the shipping box I though for sure they had made a mistake as the box weighed like 25 pounds. They didn't make a mistake and the reason it weighed so much is because they had packed in like 30 of these special packets that keep the shipment cold and fresh. I have ordered foods through the mail many times and had never seen such care taken during the shipping process.<br /><br />As for the hot fudge itself, its hands down the best hot fudge I have ever had and I have literally tried well over 50+ brands of hot fudge from all over the world. None of them even comes close to matching the Sanders recipe. I myself prefer the regular milk chocolate version but they now have 7 different flavors including Dark Chocolate, Butterscotch, Cinnamon Pear, Bittersweet Fudge, Dark Chocolate Peppermint Pattie, Carmel Apple and of course the original Milk Chocolate Hot Fudge. I have tried them all and they are all outstanding.<br /><br />The bottom line - If you love hot fudge then you owe it to yourself to at least give Sanders Hot Fudge a try. I really suggest you go all the way and order a pack of creme puffs as well. Just cut a creme puff in half, scoop some vanilla ice creme in the middle of the creme puff and pour hot fudge topping all over it. There is just nothing else like it. Again if you love Hot Fudge then you simply must try some Sanders hot fudge. It simply doesn't get any better than this!!<br /><br />5 Stars and then some!!!"

I was worried that it may not be packaged well enough, or that it may come in poor condition. However, I swallowed all my fears and finally decided to order this particular tree. When it arrived, it was packaged very well. There was no way that the tree could have moved or been shaken during shipping. It was almost packaged to well, and I almost cut the tree while trying to remove the tape around it. Health wise, the tree looked and felt very healthy. I have yet to see any health problems with it.<br /><br />Another benefit of ordering this tree, is that it comes with some extra bonsai supplies. The book, 101 Bonsai Tips, is a bit small and lacking in information. But what it does have is wonderfully informative. The trimmers of of excellent build quality, and can easily prune the leaves. Although I typically prune my Junipers with my fingers, the pruners are a nice accessories to have. I have not yet used the wire that came with it, but I have bent it around and played with it a little. It feels like it is of great quality, but I have yet to try it on a tree. Bearing in mind that all of these things come in addition to the tree, you know this is a great buy.<br /><br />If you are hesitant about ordering a bonsai tree online as I was, I assure you that this one is alright. I have no complaint about it. Also, the price of this package is extremely reasonable. I highly recomend ordering this Bonsai  pack if you are interested in starting Bonsai. If you are already a Bonsai master, but just want another tree, then this is also the one to get. I highly recomend it."

I want to provide another perspective on this product without scaring away some who may only look at the 'number of stars' versus the textual content of the review. I smoke my own bacon, hams, shoulders, ribs, etc. I'm a southerner. That's what we do. However, I use hickory, mesquite, pecan, oak, apple, etc. Lapsang Souchong tea leaves are laid out on bamboo and infused with pine smoke. Folks, pine with its natural resins is not a good wood for smoking meats. Therefore, it's unlikely you've ever tasted anything in Amercia smoked with it. Don't expect smokehouse or pit barbeque smokiness in this tea. Think more of the smokiness you'd experience from burning brush or a pile of lumber. I do love Twinings black tea and highly recommend Earl Grey, Prince of Wales, Darjeeling, English Breakfast, Irish Breakfast, Black Currant Breeze, and Orange Bliss. They are wonderful. You may thorougly enjoy the smokey essence in Lapsang Souchong. Just be advised that its not your daddy's barbeque smoke flavor."

When i opened the cookie wrapper, i gave half of it to my 3 year old and i ate the other half. I was immediately surprised by how soft the cookie was when i was splitting it in half. It was like a really really good home baked cookie. Soft, chewy and tasty. I normally do not like oatmeal raisin cookies, due to the raisins, but this cookie was surprisingly yummy. My three year old loved it so much that we had to go out and buy our own box. The cookies are soft, chewy, yummy, and healthier than other kinds of cookies, so  i would definitely recommend this product to people that have kids for a healthy yummy substitute to other sweets"

I think the problem is the main ingredient is ground up oats, then with whole oats and wheat flour, instead of the recipes I've made with more whole oats and then wheat flour.  Even though I don't really like raisins they were the best thing about these cookies.  At least a bite with a raisin was a tiny bit moister.<br /><br />Not only that but it was 170 for only one cookie.

No doubt related to the consistency, the cookie is not cloyingly sweet. Oh, it's still definitely a cookie - but you're not overwhelmed with a sugar rush. The raisins didn't add a lot of flavor - the ones I encountered weren't large or anything remotely like plump.<br /><br />Overall, this seems like a relatively low-guilt addition to a lunchbox or a desk drawer for snack time.

Frankly, these cookies are not nearly as delicious as the ones my husband and I make and ours are lower in fat and calories, with fewer additives.  In other words, healthier.<br /><br />But ""healthier"" isn't why most people buy pre-made food products and these cookies taste good enough.  I love oatmeal raisin cookies and I wasn't disappointed by these enough to dislike them.  However, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004L5UD2K"">Grandma's Homestyle Oatmeal Raisin Big Cookie, 2.5 Oz Bag (Pack of 20)</a> are lower in calories and have the same amount of fat, per cookie.  (Of course, it's hard to eat just the one when there are two in the package so you'd have to share.)<br /><br />I know that it's hard to find time to bake from scratch sometimes but the effort to do so, teaching a child how to measure and mix a recipe from scratch, to then enjoy something that the two (or three or four) of you made together, is invaluable.  Make a double batch and freeze the dough before baking and you wouldn't have to do this every week to have enough cookies to last entire month or longer.  You'll build bonding moments, create less waste, teach simple mathematics and cooking skills, and provide a far healthier snack option for your child(ren).<br /><br />And if you truly don't have the time to bake cookies, then buy some fresh fruit.  If nothing else, you'll have fewer additives and most fruit comes in it's own convenient packaging."

The major positive is that the first ingredient listed is whole grain oat flour.  Other pluses are that the cookie is not particularly sweet, individually wrapped, and it is soft, but not crumbly.  My husband and I tried these cookies for dessert last night.  The first issue was that they are 170 calories each, meaning we only had one, even though their size is not particularly large, around 3 inches in diameter.  Second, the overall taste and texture impression of the cookie is that it is commercially made; it will not remotely remind you of homemade.  Third, and personally, there are not enough raisins.  Finally, both of us noticed the cinnamon flavoring, which was border line too much; the ingredients list indicates allspice as well.  The only ""fortifications"" to the cookie are calcium (4%) and iron (8%)."

Each of the six cookies is enclosed in a sturdy plastic envelope, with a tooth-edge at the top and bottom, suitable for grasping and for tearing open the envelope.  On the plus side, all of the cookies were intact, despite shipping.  The intact nature of the cookies was largely due to the fact that they are soft (not crunchy) and secondarily due to the secure packaging.  The cookies were bland and unadventuresome, both in taste and in texture.  Although the photographs on the cardboard box and on the plastic envelope show cookies having a surface dotted withabout 12 whole raisins, it was the case that the actual cookie contains a scattering of chopped raisin bits inside.  Therefore, the consumer should not expect to be treated to a cookies bearing a cargo of plump, juicy raisins.  In paying attention to the flavor, I noticed that the cookies had a detectable raisin flavor.  Also on the plus side, in knowing (from first-hand experience) that hard oatmeal can get wedged in between fillings, resulting in damage to teeth and fillings, the older consumer will be pleased that this QUAKER product is totally inocuous, as far as dental work is concerned.  These cookies are, indeed, sooooooft!<br /><br />Ordinary oatmeal has about 61 grams carbohydrate, 12 grams protein, and 7 grams fat, per 100 grams of oatmeal (Pomeranz (1987) Modern Cereal Science and Technology (pages 350-370)).  The NUTRITION FACTS label that this QUAKER product shows that the breakdown is as follows.  Each QUAKER cookie (42 grams) contains 27 grams carbohydrate, 6 grams of fat, and only 2 grams of protein.  Hence, it can be seen, that the cookies, as compared to straight oatmeal, is somewhat low in protein.  The low protein content should not be a concern to most adults, because growth, and the issue of acquiring the proper nutrient balance to sustain growth, is generally relevant only during pregnancy and lactation, and for growing children.  If any conclusion can be made regarding this fine product, is that it could be a preferred snack food for adults who have had multiple dental fillings, and need to worry about dental damage.  Although this cookie is fine for children, please remember that much better sources of protein are available, e.g., milk, cheese, meat, fish, poultry, tofu, and legumes (peas, beans, lentils)."

So I was skeptical of this soft, ""store bought"" cookie.  I assumed it would be, well, bad.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It's made with whole grains, which imbues each cookie with 16% of daily fiber recommendations.  It was indeed soft, but it didn't seem artificially so, more like it was just cooled down from the oven.<br /><br />As I began my 'taste test', I appreciated the fact that the cookies are individually wrapped, which allows for easy transport in lunches or purses.  I took a small bite at first, because I was already prepared to be disappointed.  As that bite went down, I reached for another.  Then another.  Very tasty, as it turned out!  Soon the cookie was gone and I realized I wanted another one!  However, at 170 calories each, these are NOT ""low calorie"", they're just made with better ingredients than most.<br /><br />As for other nutrition information (other than the fiber and calorie count mentioned above), each cookie has 150 milligrams of sodium, so not too bad there.  You'll find 4% of calcium and 8% of iron (recommended daily requirements).<br /><br />The first ingredient is whole grain oat flour.  Sugar is about number 10 or so on the ingredient list.  One quibble I have is that the list of ingredients is rather lengthy.  My nutritionist has advised me to watch for products with what seem like extraordinarily long ingredient lists, probably means there's lots of stuff in there that's not exactly ""good"" for us, but it is what it is:  a factory-made, store-bought cookie that's got a pretty long list of ingredients and shelf life that don't come naturally to ""homemade cookies"".

This doesn't have that. The oats are milled to the point where the flavour is there but the texture is not. If this is a problem for you, you might want to pass. Other than that, it's probably a good idea to have a glass of milk handy.

(My favorite cookie, by the way!)  It almost has a cake like consistency, and while it isn't the type of cookie I would munch on at home while I watch a Blu-Ray, this is the type of snack I would buy for road trips or picnics.  There is a hint of brown sugar, not overwhelming, but enough that my little ones (8 and 4) remarked that they liked the sweetness of it.  My oldest, wished there were more raisins, and I would have to agree with that as well.  But I liked the whole grains. Overall, it is good, but a bit dry.<br /><br />Size-this is a larger cookie, similar to what you would get in say Subway or Starbucks.  Not overly huge, but not too small either.  I think this is a perfect snack size.<br /><br />Nutrition-at 170 calories it isn't a lightweight, but nor is it overly fattening either.  6 Grams of fat, 1.5 grams of Saturated (NOT horrific), but it has some Polyunsaturated and 3.5 grams of Monounsaturated=the 'good' kind of fat.  4 grams of fiber, good in a snack like this, but only 2 grams a protein, wish there was more.<br /><br />All in all, this isn't a snack I would buy on a regular basis.

The quality and taste are very much the same as Archway brand; that is a good thing as I consider them to be the best store-bought cookie out there.  My husband would have liked more whole oats in the mix, but understands that too few people appreciate texture in their food.<br /><br />The individual wrapping might be nice for kids' lunches but is an expensive and unecological waste for the (typical) case that a group will be eating them and/or individuals will eat more than one.  At the very, very, least wrap them two-at-a time?<br /><br />If they're priced similarly to Archway, I would expect them to do at least as well as the equivalent Archway cookies."

They need to be a little more moist, especially since the whole point of cookies in individual foil wrappers is to protect moisture. The taste is traditional cinnamon raisin, and the taste is fine, but in this crowded market, with many competitors, Quaker cannot afford for the cookies not to be perfectly moist.<br /><br />I remember back when the Quaker Oats came in a round, cardboard container. On the side of that container was a recipe for oatmeal cookies, which my mom used to make frequently. Those cookies, with Nestle's chocolate chips added, were the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookies I ever tasted. Now, if Quaker could market those cookies and make 'em taste as good as mom's, then they'd have something."

They are pretty bland, just a mild raisiny sweetness and the texture is dry and crumbly and turns a little mealy upon chewing.  I tried them in coffee and in milk to see if they were better that way and while the taste was a little better the texture just became wet and mealy and bits fell off into my coffee.  A soft cookie can definitely be moist, hold up to milk and have a bit of chew to it.  Pepperidge Farm makes an addictive soft baked oatmeal cookie."

These cookies taste fine, but they are pretty dry and fairly crumbly. Not overly enjoyable. They'd be fine dunked in milk or something, but I'd be afraid half of it would fall into the glass. Little Debbie and Pepperidge Farms have both proven that you can sell packaged, soft-baked cookies that are still moist. Plus, these seem over-packaged. Individually wrapped cookies? Okay, yeah it's handy for a packed lunch or something, but really? That seems excessive. I'd probably skip these."

563291,B007JFMH8M,A3IMO49QD6OYKN,D. A. Ross,1,1,4,1343088000,Guilty pleasure or guiltless treat?,"Let's be honest: there are few desserts that can compete with a fresh baked, chewy oatmeal cookie. Even better when it's oatmeal raisin! As such, I was somewhat skeptical of the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookies, as I'm generally let down by store-bought cookies. Well, I'm here to tell you, I have become a believer. I have seen the light! Here's a breakdown of what I think overall:<br /><br />TEXTURE:<br />The package says ""soft-baked,"" and brother, it is no lie. These cookies are soft, moist and chewy, thus negating the need to do the milk dunk. Though, ice cold milk is a requisite with cookies, regardless.<br /><br />SERVING SIZE:<br />At 42g, these cookies are pretty well-sized and will definitely satisfy even the hardiest of sugar seekers. It would take 3 Oreos to match the size of one oatmeal raisin. No contest.<br /><br />TASTE:<br />Dynamite. Sweet cinnamon and raisins definitely prevail in this recipe, giving the oatmeal an authentic, homemade flavor.<br /><br />NUTRITIONAL PROFILE:<br />Now, this is where Quaker loses a few points with me. Though certainly not the unhealthiest cookie out there (in fact, it's probably on the healthier end of the spectrum), there are a few select ingredients that could be avoided, such as corn syrup. But, each cookie does contain 4g of fiber, as well as several grams of healthy fats, and 2g protein! For those who are curious, here's the complete nutrient breakdown:<br /><br />Serving Size: 1 Cookie (42g)<br />Calories: 140<br />Total Fat: 6g (9%)<br />Saturated Fat: 1.5g (8%)<br />Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g<br />Monounsaturated Fat: 3.5g<br />Cholesterol: 15mg (5%)<br />Sodium: 150mg (6%)<br />Total Carbohydrate: 27g (9%)<br />Dietary Fiber: 4g (16%)<br />Sugars: 12g<br />Other Carbohydrate: 11g<br />Protein: 2g<br /><br />Ingredients: Whole Grain Oat Flour, Enriched Flour (Bleached and Unbleached Wheat Flour, Niacin, Reduced Iron, Thiamin Mononitrate, Riboflavin, Folic Acid), Raisins, Whole Grain Rolled Oats, Sugar, Whole Wheat Flour, Palm and High Oleic Canola Oil (with TBHQ [preservative]), Fructose, Invert Sugar Syrup, Mid-Oleic Sunflower Oil, Raisin Paste, Inulin, Granola (Whole Grain Rolled Oats, Sugar, Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil*, Honey, Brown Sugar Molasses), Dried Eggs, Modified Corn Starch, Corn Syrup, Polydextrose, Leavening Agents (Sodium Bicarbonate, Ammonium Bicarbonate), Oat Fiber, Propylene Glycol Mono- and Diesters of Fat and Fatty Acids, Mono- and Diglycerides, Soy Lecithin, BHT [to preserve freshness], Citric Acid [to preserve freshness], Wheat Gluten, Molasses, Calcium Phosphate, Salt, Natural Flavor, Cinnamon, Allspice, Corn Starch, Enzymes. *Adds a Dietarily Insignificant Amount of Trans Fat<br /><br />PACKAGING:<br />Stellar! Each cookie is individually wrapped for easy travel and consumption, so parents can toss one in their kid's lunch box, or tote one to the office for an easy snack/dessert.<br /><br />COST:<br />From what I can tell, the Quaker cookies are about par for the course in terms of cost, neither on the high nor low end, making for a pretty economical choice. Based on Amazon's pricing as I write this, the cost is slightly less than $1.00 per cookie. Not bad!<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />If you're looking to indulge in something sweet, somewhat healthy, and reminds you of a homemade treat, you can't do much better than Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookies. The only challenge will be trying to resist a second helping, especially if you still have ice cold milk remaining in your glass."
563292,B007JFMH8M,A23RZIU0N8K2KR,M. Caceres,1,1,5,1343088000,Great to take to the office or for kids to take to school!,"My box has an expiration date of September 13, 2012, which is a little bit less than 2 months (which is okay, because the cookies get eaten up fast!). The cookies, made with whole grain Quaker oats, are definitely soft baked, and you can taste the delicious oatmeal in every bite! My only criticism of these cookies is that even though they had raisins, I couldn't taste them! It was practically just an oatmeal taste.<br /><br />Each cookie's size is a bit larger the palm of an adult hand. I love that they are individually wrapped because it means I can take them on the go with me! Each cookie is 170 calories, has 1.5 gram of fat, 150mg of sodium, and 12gram of sugar. I don't recommend the cookies for warding off hunger if you are on a diet as the calories per cookie is pretty high. This is good as treats for children's lunches though or to have them in your car when ever you go hungry.<br /><br />Also, I dropped one of the cookies (still in the wrapper) on the floor and it did not crumble, which I was happy with."
563293,B007JFMH8M,ADX0OP5C8DX1T,mdwilson,1,1,5,1342483200,Awesome Product,"This is a must have for those sweet tooth cravings. My youngest child is 6 and isn't much of a sweets eater.

There's nothing like bring in the middle of the ravenousness of pregnancy and being told to watch what you eat. But it did get me to start paying better attention to how I could still enjoy foods I loved while making healthier choices. One of the things I learned to balance was fiber intake. Ever since I've made a point to always go for whole grains when the choice is available and Quaker's products tend to make the best of combining deliciousness with heart-healthy oats.<br /><br />I recently received a sample of these Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies from Influenster and they're surprisingly good. Maybe not quite as good as the ones my mom made when I was a kid but still a tasty treat reminiscent of the childhood classic. Packed with raisins and big enough you only need one they're a satisfying snack or dessert option. Since traditional oatmeal cookies aren't my favorite I'm going to have to try one of their other flavors like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JFMH96"">Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Chocolate Almond, 8.8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JFMHBE"">Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Cranberry and Yogurt, 8.8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>.

These soft oatmeal raisin cookies are actually quite good. Each cookie weighs about 1.48 ounces, and is about 170 calories (27 grams of carbohydrates). So, while they are not exactly a low-calorie snack, they aren't too bad either.<br /><br />The nice thing about them is that they are nicely filling, making them a nice afternoon snack, when you need a little something to get you through work. And, while oatmeal raisin cookies are not my favorite snack, I did find these to be quite good.

Well they have been trying to expand from just the basic oatmeal for some time. These soft cookies are tasty and satisfying. In my family you can tell how good they are by how quickly they disappear. Weel - they disappeared in swift order. In fact I barely got to taste more than one. The general consensus is these are 'just like homemade. There is not greater compliment that can be paid. They are packaged conveniently for inclusion in school lunches etc. They certainly make a great accompaniment for tea or coffee for that unwinding moment all of us need at somour day.

That's probably because my wife makes such awesome chocolate cookies.  When I do get an opportunity to try an oatmeal and raisin cookie it is usually from a store-bought package.  I usually come away impressed with how moist these pre-packaged cookies are.  That's what surprised me most about Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie;  They're soft but they aren't moist.  There is a distinct soft dryness to the cookies. The taste was good and my grand daughter quickly ate up most of them.  She liked them because they are tasty and soft.

I couldn't get mine to try more than one bite. Even as an oatmeal cookie, they aren't that good. We found them salty and bland. Yes they were soft, but also crumbly, which made a mess.

I did note that was in several crumbly pieces when I opened the package, but it obviously didn't change the taste of the cookie itself. It just made it a little messy to eat, but in my house with a toddler that is nothing new. Speaking of toddler, SHE LOVED IT! She actually wanted more after the package was empty, and was pretty upset when I kept telling her it was all gone. :) Looks like we'll be getting some more to have around the house and maybe a little bribery for the diaper bag. :)"

I love the baked through flavor of the cookies, they baked to perfection - not underbaked and certainly not overbaked because they are nice and chewy.

And it is defintely enough for a snack - at 1.48 oz and 170 calories - that's plenty. The raisins, too were outstanding. But the cookie itself was not great tasting.

They are well baked to the point had they spent another minute or two in the oven they may be burnt (which is exactly how I like my cookies).  And even though they are soft, they are firm enough they do not crumble in your hand.  And there is enough raisins you will have at least one or more in every bite.  On the flip side, the ingredient list is a bit lengthy with a few ingredients that I cannot pronounce (is a red flag for me)."

The cookies were very soft and tasty.  Each cookie was full of raisins, and still retained an ""oatmeal"" taste.  They are sized perfectly, one cookie is big enough to satisfy a craving without eating half of the box.  My only complaint is that they were crumbly.  This was fine for my 17 month old twins, as they still don't have all of their teeth, and have trouble biting and chewing hard cookies.  I had a problem with the crumbly texture, because when I tried to dip the cookie into a glass of milk, a big chunk of it broke off and fell to the bottom of the glass, where it turned into inedible mush.  Aside from that one complaint, I have nothing bad to say about these yummy cookies."

They seem to have achieve the perfect level of sweetness, unlike most cookies with are a lot more sugary tasting. Kudos.<br /><br />There are also plenty of raisins, so at least part of its sweetness comes from a more natural source.<br /><br />My only complaint is the cookies were surprisingly dry. They are very well packaged, so I don't think that was the problem. Maybe they're made that way. But I've also heard that some products aren't great to order by mail in hot summer months, as they may dry out. I know mine probably spent at least a few hours on the porch in 90 degree weather. Dunking the cookie in tea or milk, or microwaving them for 15 seconds helped a lot.<br /><br />Otherwise, these were yummy and seem more healthy than other choices."

Just 2 of these cookies gives you that satisfying full feeling. Since it is made out of oatmeal and raisins, we could classify it as a healthy snack. But on the nutritional breakdown, would be better if this snack would go down on a less than 5mg cholesterol. The per serving content of cholesterol is 15mg, sugar is 12g, so as with any other food, moderation is the key. Nevertheless, anything oatmeal gives you a great start on eating, whether to maintain a healthy lifestyle or starting one."

I even liked that they were individually packaged--great for lunch boxes or for keeping cookie monsters from devouring the entire package in one sitting. The individual cookies weren't huge but they were big and chewy enough to satisfy a sweet tooth with just one package. They weren't overly sweet or overloaded with raisins--someone must have studied the cookie-to-raisin ratio and came up with the perfect number. I'll definitely much on these again."

There is a sense of artificiality about the flavor that may come from preservatives or flavoring additives. My family ate all the samples we received, but there was no real drive to go out and buy a box, even among my otherwise enthusiastic cookie-eating teens.  I think that the product needs a trip back to the drawing board if the goal is authentic oatmeal cookie taste and not just texture.  Sorry!"

I have always been someone that sticks to either cheaper brands, or the kind of cookies that are made in a markets own bakery.  Personally I think the latter are the best there is in most cases as far as store bought is concerned..  As for these Quaker cookies I found them to be just average in taste.  The box I got held very fresh cookies individually wrapped that were satisfying in flavor, but not at all anything special.  Personally I don't think the heavier cost of these are worth it for just being a famous brand.  You can do at least just as good with other store bought brands, and much better in my opinion in buying your local markets cookies.  On the other hand if you happen to be a big fan Quaker Oats cookies, or just enjoy the particular flavor of these, buying them here in the big 12 pack is not a bad deal at all.  The cost is enough to get you the free shipping, and the convenience along with the reasonable price makes it a sold deal.  Enjoy if these are your favor.. : )"

The only draw back are they're too dry. Still, much better than many other similar cookies made by other companies, some who make their products even drier and why sweeter. Still, with a cup of tea or coffee they make a pretty good snack or bit of an after dinner treat.

Oatmeal cookies are one of my favorites so I gave these a try.<br /><br />The packaging is fine but the cookie does not have a very good taste. It has a dry texture to it, not very oat-like at all. They are soft, but not moist. There were plenty of raisens but not enough spice for my taste. On the positive side, they do contain more fiber than most cookies, but at 170 calories each, they are a little fattening."

Not even close to appetizing. It's amazing, how can something be chewy and yet powdery dry and quite tasteless simultaneously? Quaker's R&D figured out the conundrum and produced these ""cookies"". I assume it's the oat bran since I had similar experiences with using it when it was THE thing to do (e.g., pancakes). However, what ever it is, it ain't good! I do not recommend these, not even to my sworn enemies!"

Each cookie is individually wrapped vs. opening up a whole box which makes for a good snack to take the edge off of your day.<br /><br />Each cookie is 170 calories with 6 grams of fat (9% of recommended daily value) and 4 grams of dietary fiber (16% of the recommended daily value), so I really don't want to eat more than one a day!"

I can grab one and stick it in my pocket on my way out the door in the morning.<br /><br />The cookies themselves are big and a good thickness. They are soft with out being crumbly. The promised raisins are mostly small bits of chopped raisins and don't really add to the flavor of the cookie. I would have like whole raisins. The taste is mostly oatmeal with just the right amount of cinnamon. They are also dry. You really need an accompanying beverage with these. They are hearty enough that one makes a good snack.<br /><br />While I would never mistake these for Mom's oatmeal cookies (or mine for that matter) they're not too bad for ""store-bought.""

A little on the bland side, but the good side of the bland side, if there is such a thing. They are a nice sized cookie...bigger than other packaged cookies that come in the plastic trays. They have the perfect amount of raisins in them - not over packed, but just enough. I guess I expected them to be more ""oatmealy"" since they are from Quaker, after all. They have the oatmeal raisin cookie flavor going on, but not the texture.<br /><br />The complaint that I have with them is that they are SO very dry. You will definitely want to have a big glass of milk handy. That itself was another problem for me - I don't drink milk. I just don't like it. Yes, it is a personal problem, not a fault of Quaker of course, but what else do you drink with cookies? Nothing else seems to go quite right with cookies. I do like to dunk cookies in milk, but these Oatmeal Raisin cookies are not a good choice for that because they would get mushy and fall apart right away.<br /><br />I can't say that i'd buy these.

At 3 in the morning when you're having a cookie emergency, they'll do just fine with a glass of milk or a cup of tea.  But don't expect a lot of home-baked flavor, or even the kind of moist chewiness you think of when you think of an oatmeal cookie because it's simply not there.<br /><br />I can't really recommend them, but I can't entirely dismiss them either.

They're soft and chewy with a slightly sweet aftertaste. However, there's nothing that really distinguishes them either. There are 6 cookies in a box.

Most cookies labeled ""oatmeal"" have enriched white flour as their main ingredient.  These cookies also have a generous amount of juicy raisins, not the dried out raisins found in some other brands.<br /><br />I did find the cookies a bit too sweet for my taste, especially on the first bite.  The sweetness was much less strong after that first bite. There is a natural grain aftertaste that I found pleasant but others may not.  Also, I found the cookies a bit too crumbly when the individual packs are first opened. I found that if I let the opened package sit in a sealed contained for a day or two the texture was more to my liking.<br /><br />I liked the individual packages so that you can eat just one without the rest going stale.  I also liked that the ingredient list is on each package; this is very important for those with food allergies if the box is not available.<br /><br />All in all though these are a good treat.

I thought they tasted good, but I found them to be a little on the dry side.  A lot of packaged cookies have an odd chemical aftertaste, but I didn't really notice much with these.<br /><br />However, I would like to see better choices on ingredients.  First, I don't understand the need for both bleached and unbleached flour.  Quaker should just stick with unbleached.  Second, I accept sugar as an ingredient.  These are cookies.  Cookies are sweet, and I expect sugar.  Yet why do they also have to use fructose, invert sugar syrup, corn syrup, and polydextrose?  These also contain molasses, which are a natural sweetener.  Finally, these have both corn starch and modified corn starch.  Again, why?  You may find other ingredients that you would question, but these seemed like the glaring issues to me.  In the end, I think this is too much to overcome when you combine it with a relatively high percentage (60 out of 170) of calories from fat.  In short, I cannot recommend these cookies."

I had not done any rsearch on them previously but remembered the oatmeal cookies my grandmother baked and how tasty they were. I was anxious to try out the Quaker version. When the box arrived the first thing I noticed, right on the front of the box, was that each of the six individually wrapped cookies contains a whopping 170 calories. When I was a super active kid I ate my grandmother's cookies with impunity although I did not know the calorie count. I was always a skinny kid regardless of what I ate. Now, as an adult, I am no longer skinny but not a lard butt either and I do not aspire to become one by eating these cookies. However, I wanted to do a taste test so I took a bite and quickly realized that these are simply run of the mill oatmeal cookies. They have no distinguishing characteristics other than the major calorie count. Dry, stale and tasteless are the best descriptions I can come up with."

They are soft, but they are also very dry. The raisins are totally desiccated and not even chewy because they are so dry and shriveled. The cookies themselves have a dry, rather powdery texture. At 170 calories per cookie, I plan to stick with Quaker's chewy granola bars which taste much better and are in the 90-110 calorie range."

The feeling of being a simple cookie are worth their while. My only gripes about them is that their only 6 in a package so if you really are a heavy cookie snacker, you'll be a bit dissapointed. Also, there aren't that many in a package compared to the amount there are in a box from Little Debbie or other brands of cookies.

They are not too bad when it comes to nutrition either - each one of them is just 170 calories. The only downside for me about these cookies is that they seem to be a bit too crumbly, and not gooey enough. Each cookie comes in an individual wrapping, so tehy are very convenient to take with you for a snack on a go, and the individual wrapping also helps preserve freshness.

This is the high point. It goes down hill from there.<br /><br />Let me start with the taste. It is average at best, it is soft, but very cardboardy in taste which makes the sweetness of the raisins stand out even more. Often times with food, the trade-offs are great taste with bad nutrition versus average/bad taste with good nutrition. This one has both average/bad taste and bad nutrition. So what's the point of eating not-very-tasty junk food?<br /><br />Because let's face it, that's what this is. The list of ingredients is unnaturally long - 16 lines (yes sixteen lines) of ingredients on the box, including fan favorite Corn Syrup. This is just an oatmeal cookie for crying out loud.<br /><br />And here's the bad nutrition: 170 calories per cookie, including 5% cholesterol, 12g sugars, 6% sodium (150mg). On the plus side, 4g of dietary fiber and 2g of protein. Other numbers from the label: 6g of fat (1.5g saturated), 27g total carbs, and single digit percentages of iron and calcium. Each cookie weighs around 1.5 ounces, so this is not a giant cookie.<br /><br />If you are going to eat a cookie, at least eat a cookie you actually like. Otherwise, what's the point?"

There's nothing better than a homemade cookie.  Having tried these and shared them with some co-workers I can honestly say that it's not just me that wasn't impressed.  There wasn't much said that was positive.  For being a soft baked cookie it tasted awfully dry.  It was almost more like a cereal bar rather than a cookie.  There was no yummy buttery taste.  They just weren't worth the 170 cals per cookie.  The only thing positive that was said is that it is convienient to have them separately packed for lunches and on the go snacks.

For a store bought cookie, they are very good.  There is nothing artificial tasting to them, they stay soft, but have a good chewy texture that holds together well.  They taste a little dry, but are not dried out or too brittle.  Most home made cookies dry out and turn brittle on me in a few days.  These hold up well.  The raising ratio seems just right, not too many but a very good balance of sweetness & wetness in the right places.  They are moderately sized, smaller that I would have guessed from the large picture and size on the box, but seemed filling enough because they were sufficiently dense.  They are not perfection compared to actual home baking fresh out of the oven, but relative to store bought cookies, and other oatmeal cookies, I thought they were very good.<br /><br />One thing to remember is that these are not as healthy as implied by all the good things promoted about using Quaker oats and being a good source of fiber.  They do have 16% fiber and pack in other good things, but they do carry 9% of your daily value of fat too, per cookie.  Compared to other cookies or snacks which offer no positives, these pack in good things along with the bad.  Just don't think consider them as good as just eating an apple without any fat.  But if the alternative is to pick up potato chips or other cookies, these at least pack in health benefits if you are going to eat such a snack anyway."

I took a chance on this brand because of an Amazon promotion, but I don't think I'll be buying any more.<br /><br />Like another reviewer, I knew I was in trouble when I opened the bag.  Characteristic of the beans that I've enjoyed the most is a rich, oily sheen left on the beans from the roasting process.  These aromatic oils are filled with flavor and provide a richness to your brew.  This bag?  The beans looked dry and oil-free.  I confirmed this when I put it through my grinder.  The grinds didn't stick to the grinder and the lid because there were no oils to bind it.  A disappointment!<br /><br />I thought to myself though, that the proof is in the taste.  So I brewed a pot and confirmed my suspicion; the coffee lacked depth and really tasted like coffee flavored water.  Now in case you think that my wife and I like our brews dark and strong, that's not the case.  We're both in preference to roasts on the light-medium end of the scale.  But this is an entirely different animal -- the flavor is just....off.<br /><br />If you're purchasing from Amazon, consider <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SJHO4M"">Kicking Horse Coffee Z-Wrangler Medium, Whole Bean Coffee, 12.3-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)</a> instead.  When you open those tins, the aroma...it's just out of this world.  The beans are characteristically oily with a beautiful, chocolate sheen. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Z613JO"">Magnum Kona Blend Coffee, Whole Bean, 1 Lb Bag</a> is another that I can heartily recommend (though I prefer the Kicking Horse just a tad bit more).<br /><br />Yes, it's more costly, but really, it's a small luxury in this frugal era of ""staycations"" and still cheaper than buying Starbucks or DD every day.  It's safe to say that I will not be buying any more coffee of this brand."

For the foreseeable future, however, I'm on a tight budget that makes keeping stocked up with expensive coffees for daily drinking just not tenable.<br /><br />The roast of this breakfast blend is on the lighter side of medium, but that's just what I want first thing in the morning. It has a smooth taste, very little bitterness (practically none), and the aroma is pleasant both before and after brewing.<br /><br />Is this coffee the greatest ever? Not by a long shot, no. But if you're looking for a decent, whole bean coffee that's a cut above the crap that comes preground in a can, and costs considerably less than $10/lb, you could do a lot worse than this stuff. I guess the best endorsement I could give this coffee is that I've been drinking it for the past month and I'll be ordering more as soon as I finish writing this review. Give it a shot!"

I'm a big fan of the original Milano cookies -- the cookies themselves are light, crispy, and perfectly paired with rich dark chocolate.  So what could go wrong with Milano cookies filled with dark, sumptuous chocolate creme?<br /><br />Well, MILANO MELTS are disappointing.  First, the cookie itself:  It's sort of a ""double-thick"" Milano cookie, which means it lacks the lightness and the delicate crispness of the original Milanos.  It's very hard around the edges, and the texture seems dense and unappetizing.  Then, there's the ""dark chocolate creme"":  It just lacks the flavor of the chocolate on the original Milanos.  Additionally, there's nowhere as much creme as you see in the TV commercials (or pictured on the package).  The creme is mostly located in one half of the cookie -- I took my first bite and wondered, ""where is the creme?""  All I saw was a thin line of chocolate, which was tasteless buried inside that thick cookie.  There was more creme on the other side of the cookie, but it was nothing like what I was expecting.<br /><br />These are simply not as good as the original Milano cookies (which are wonderful).  This is an interesting-sounding idea that just didn't pan out.  Stick to the original Milanos -- they will not disappoint."

Second, there was hardly any chocolate in there and what was in there was tasteless.

I used to just add the juice from a bottle of olives into my martini but I would go through the juice faster than the olives and my fridge was holding multiple ""juiceless"" bottles of olives. When I found this product I thought it was too good to be true - pure olive juice with no olives?? Then I saw the price so I had to jump on the deal.  Saucy Mama's olive juice is delicious and potent! I use about half of the amount of juice I normally would use from a bottle of olives, making the product last a long time. I have given a few bottles away to dirty martini lovers and have gone through quite a few at home and even almost a year after my purchase I still have a few bottles left to use.

I never thought much about the different brands until I heard many years ago that President Ronald Reagan's favorite brand was Jelly Belly. Out of curiosity, I tried them. They were excellent! They were  smaller, quite brightly flavored and more expensive. In any case, I quite enjoyed them but we try to keep our consumption low. We try to eat (or serve) very little candy and when we serve it or eat it, the candy has to be first rate.<br /><br />Well, my wife and I were wandering the isles of our local warehouse store and there was a big display of Kirkland Signature Jelly Belly jelly beans. They came in four-pound jars and were much less expensive than the small packets we usually bought. How could we resist? They were excellent, just as we expected. The variety of flavors is incredible. Some people like to pick out types of all one kind and others just dip in and chew a mouthful to see what happens. I happen to be one of the latter. We keep the jar of jelly beans around mainly for guests and special events such as Halloween and birthdays, but now and then the temptation is just too much and we modestly indulge. They're really much too tasty!<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
563957,B001XSMANI,A331MVAMZ2WBH8,buttonskay,2,2,5,1330992000,"I love these, and I don't even normally like jelly beans...","I have never been a big fan of jelly beans...I am more of a giant chewy sweet tart person. At my last quilting group meeting, one of the ladies brought a bag of what I thought was jelly beans. She offered me one, I respectfully declined saying thanks but I really don't like jelly beans. She replied, along with a few of the other gals that ""These aren't jelly beans, they're jelly belly beans!"". So, I decided to try them. Now here I am on Amazon after purchasing this 4 lb. package of jelly belly beans, I priced them in several places, this is definitely the best price. I did wonder when I saw Kirkland Signature before the Jelly Belly Beans that they would not be the same ones; I needn't have worried as these taste exactly the same as the others I have had."

On a trip to Hershey, Pa she discovered Jelly Bellies which came in a nice platic canister.  I think it was about 2lbs.  The kids in the office would go nuts over them.  I haven't had them in years but when I came across this 4 lb wonder I had to order them.  I love the crazy flavors.  In fact, I think popcorn is my favorite.  Don't know if I could eat a handful of just that flavor but one at a time is just terrific.  As for the price, I don't belong to Costco and to save $3.50* wouldn't be worth a trip there because in the end I would probably spend a couple of hundred dollars there (like I do when I got to Target).  With Amazon I get my $25. worth to get free shipping and then I'm outa here.  *And no sales tax makes up for some of the price difference because you'd pay it at Costco.  Also, in the long run, I save because I've gotten some absurdly cheap prices here."

Not only are they the same 49 flavors you get when you purchase a 49 flavor pack from Jelly Belly, but these also have the Jelly Belly logo.  They taste identical to a standard purchase of Jelly Belly Jelly Beans as well but cost much less per pound it seems.  To be honest my original review of Jelly Belly brand jelly Beans sums up Kirkland Signature Jelly Belly's perfectly.<br /><br />- As Seen on the Jelly Belly 2-pound Pouch review -<br /><br />""The jelly belly's I got were excellent quality as I am used to with the Jelly Belly brand. There is no comparison between a Jelly Belly bean and a generic jelly bean you find in the supermarket. Jelly Belly beans are richly flavored, with each flavored bean having a distinct flavor to it. This isn't just some sugary bean you pop into your mouth and enjoy a sweet treat. Each tiny bean is packed with flavor, and by having 49 distinct flavors (plus mix n' match combos) the variety makes each portion of jelly beans a flavorful adventure.""<br /><br />*<br />The only real difference here is that Kirkland Signature comes out much cheaper per pound.  Amazon seems to typical be charging around $7.80 to $8.99  per pound for Jelly Belly...  Kirkland Signature comes in at around $6.50 per pound (as of 11/25/2011).  Still that is a steep price to pay for delicious jelly beans, but it is worth it.  I usually won't pay more than around $7.99/lb for Jelly Belly so these Kirkland Signature's come in at a good price range.<br /><br />This product I would of given 5 stars (just like the Jelly belly 2-pound pouch) but what holds it back is that Jelly Belly's make for a rather expensive treat; But a treat worth indulging in!  As for the price, yes you can easily get this product at Costco for cheaper (you can get 3-pound tubs of Jelly Belly at BJ's Warehouse also), but for an online purchase the price is quite fair.<br /><br />NOTE: I've included a list of all 49 flavors contained in this 4-pound tub in the comment section of the review"

As a long time Jelly Belly connoisseur, I would attest that these are indeed real Jelly Belly jellybeans, but there are 3 differences I have found between this jar and the smaller bags that you can purchase at your local supermarket:<br /><br />1. These beans do not have the little ""Jelly Belly"" white logo stamped on the beans.<br /><br />2. These beans come in 49 flavors as opposed to the regular 30 or 39 flavors that the assorted store bags come in. This might attest to the ""What was that flavor? These taste different than the supermarket beans"" claims of some reviewers. (Officially, the Jelly Belly website lists 50 official flavors. Anyone know which flavor was left out of this jar? :)<br /><br />3. Most importantly, I've noticed that the distribution of the assorted flavors seems less uniform in these big jars. I'm about 1/2 way through a jar and have yet to find a peach, Dr. Pepper, caramel corn or cappuccino and have only had a few buttered popcorn, juicy pear and top banana, but there seems to be a lot more of lemon, lime, orange and cherry. Understandably, it makes sense that the more exotic and probably more expensive to produce flavors are included less frequently in such a large, economy priced jar.<br /><br />Otherwise, these are as real as I can tell and there is still a pretty good assortment of flavors, just don't expect a lot of buttered popcorn..."

Jelly Belly explains on their site: ""on occasion other companies repackage our products...Please check with the packaging company regarding possible peanut and tree nut exposure.""  If you buy from Jelly Belly you will pay more and wait longer for shipping but the jelly beans are only manufactured in a plant that processes nuts, but not on the same equipment.  I work in a school with a strict allergen policy and they wouldn't accept anything made on the same equipment as nuts, although they would accept jelly beans made in the same plant that processes nuts.  At least my husband and his colleagues enjoyed them!  If you don't have to worry about allergies, these are a great buy and contain a variety  of delicious flavors.  If you want to know what you are eating, the label contains pictures of the jelly beans with their flavors listed underneath.  These jelly beans are even kosher(under the O_U) and pareve.  If you do have allergies, it's best to be informed before you buy."

Flavorful!,"Of all the light or healthy versions of canned soups by Campbell's (and others, too), this is my favorite. True, I happen to like most things that are Mexican in flavor, so that's a factor. But after sampling some ""diet-friendly"" soups that were bland or boring or heavy on the celery flavor (hate that), this was a lovely change.<br /><br />I've made sure to keep it stocked in my pantry for over a year now.<br /><br />It's tomatoey brothy, it's got black beans and chicken and rice, but it's not stew-like. It still has plenty of broth, so it's adaptable. I tend to sprinkle some low-fat cheddar on top to add to the flavor and texture. Some days, I'll open a can of black beans and add it for more fiber. When I want to splurge, I add more beans, corn, low fat cheese and a tiny dollop of lite sour cream.<br /><br />If you have leftover veggies and rice, you can thicken it into a stew. I've done it, and it works.<br /><br />Some info: One cup has 130 calories. It has 480 mg of sodium per serving, and 2 g of fat--one of those saturated--plus 2 grams of fiber and 8 grams of protein.<br /><br />This is just a fun soup and tasty and a winner from Campbell's. I hope it stays in their line permanently.<br /><br />A note: The convenient microwavable can version of this doesn't taste as good. It probably has to do with it being cooked IN the can in the nuker, maybe, not sure. But I did notice it tasted ""tinny"" in that other packaging. I'd recommend THIS can and cooking in a non-reactive pot (ie, stainless steel), because this broth is very tomatoey.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br />Mir"

Riley,82,83,5,1251849600,An extremely flavorful light-roast coffee,"One of the pleasures of a Keurig is that you can serve a friend or a guest a cup of coffee that will please them and their tastes, not just what you brew for yourself everyday.  I happen to enjoy strong, deeply roasted blends (the kind that you usually find at the specialty coffee shops which seem to be all over the place now).  However, not everyone shares my enjoyment of a strong, full-bodied cup of coffee.<br /><br />I have many friends who often say something like ""I love coffee but Starbucks is just too strong for me"".  Enter Donut Blend.  I have purchased many boxes of Coffee People's Donut Shop Coffee and it is a favorite for many of my friends and family.  When Timothy's announced that they were coming out with the ""Original Donut Blend"" I got in line to try it.  Here is my take on it:<br /><br />It is certainly a little lighter than Coffee People's version but the taste is more complex with clean, bright notes of spice and low acidity.  Surprisingly, it reminds me a little of the Peaberry Kona coffee that I brought back from Hawaii.  It is a perfect blend for those who like their coffee black or with just a little cream and still want it to taste like coffee.  If someone drinks several cups a day I think that Timothy's Donut Blend will not overwhelm their taste buds and will still taste fresh cup after cup.  Mind you, I drink Newman's Own Bold Blend on a regular basis and will continue to do so, but if I am having more than two cups (for those ""special"" mornings when nothing seems to go right) or if I am having a cup later in the day I will drink this one.<br /><br />Just rating it on what I want in a coffee I give it four stars, but judging it for what it is (and not just what I like), it fully delivers and deserves five stars.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK"">Coffee People Medium Extra Bold, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]"

A rating<br />of one point meant ""Perfect, couldn't be better"", and five points<br />indicated ""Don't like this one"".  We rated one to nine cups of each of 30<br />coffees evaluated.  Timothy's Extra Bold Parisian Nights came out on top<br />with the most number one ratings.<br /><br />We found that our preference was for the Extra Bold Roasts.

It may actually be better than German chocolate cake--it's like a no-cal, fat-free dessert.  My favorite way to drink it right now is to throw in a packet of Splenda and a little bit of Organic Valley chocolate soy milk, though it's good without sweetener or creamer.  It's chocolaty, with a hint of coconut.  I highly recommend for anyone who likes coffee (it's not a weak coffee, like most of the flavored kcups I've tried).

We all enjoy different coffees in our household and making a pot of any type coffee is a waste. My husband is an espresso drinker, so I purchased Timothy's World Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso coffee to be made with the small setting on the coffee maker which uses 5.25 oz water. This makes it stronger, and he really has enjoyed this coffee. I really recommend this to anyone who enjoys a bold espresso coffee. He was born and raised in Italy and has purchased his coffee grounds from Italy for years to make an authentic cup of espresso. He is fussy about his espresso, so if he likes this one, it must be good."

Our family are Dunkin Donut coffee fans.  We even fill the my k-cup with preground DD coffee occasionally.  I found the Timothy's Donut Blend to be very bland, almost watery.  I have the Keurig that allows 4 sizes of cups to be brewed.  I usually brew on the 3rd largest size.  I decided to try this coffee with a smaller cup and it was better, but I wish it worked well at the larger sizes.<br /><br />This probably explains the discrepancies in the reviews.  Those who can only brew (or choose to brew) smaller sizes probably like this coffee.<br /><br />Make sure you check the price before you buy.  Click more buying choices to get to Amazon's price which is almost half the price of Liquid Nation's and it is eligible for prime.  Why doesn't that show up as a default?"

I have to say that I haven't been disappointed. The cups contain a blend of arabica and kona coffee.  They brew with a nice aroma and color.  I would describe them as a medium roast with a medium strength.  Depending on your mood you can adjust the strength by adjusting the cup size and changing your creamer.  I've had success using whole milk, half and half, and light cream, with light cream being the best in my opinion.  The taste is mellow and very smooth.  I have read other reviews here that have described them as weak or tasteless.  This is simply not the case.  I would compare it to the coffee from Dunkin Donuts.  If you prefer your coffee extra bold, dark roasted, or strong (Starbucks) then you are just not going to be happy with these.  Also, if you prefer to ""double brew"" your cups to get the most for your money, you will be very disappointed.  These will brew a delicious cup of coffee, but only if you use them as directed.  Finally I have to say that Amazon is the best place to buy these.  They have the best prices and fast shipping.  Add this to your subscribe and save to get 15% extra off."

I drink about 4 to 5 cups of black coffee a day and have tried different roasts and beans over the years to nail what -I-  consider the best for me in price and flavor. I tried some expensive coffee beans that ended up in an open container in the fridge just to take away the odors instead of throwing it away, I tried *tarbucks my favorites Verona, Colombian and Sumatra and their anniversary blend. Then here comes -Coffee Beans Direct-, my ""find"" for quality, price and variety, and started telling my people about them . . . I tried coffee bean direct's coffee for about a year now, I used to get the six bean espresso blend for a while then I bought four 1 lb bags of different coffee beans to try to find something different for a change or to ""discover"" something better for my palate, and to use them in my saeco odea automatic espresso machine, in lattes and americanos. I tried (in order of my liking) city roast Papua New Guinea, dark sumatra, dark brazilian santos and still have a french roast bag that i haven't tried yet, and I would place the six bean espresso blend between the dark sumatra and the brazilian santos (maybe even tied with the sumatra), now again this is in regards to the ability to make great americanos and lattes, I drink americanos during the week and lattes on weekends. Like I said I drink my coffee black with no additives and filtered water, don't like to spoil the subtle aromas and flavors (of course unless is a latte). . . made an americano with the papua new guinea for my girlfriend which also likes good coffee, on her way to work and she called me just to ask me what kind of coffee I used because it was excellent. I also had noted that it is excellent for my americano but I noticed that i need an extra shot of espresso for my lattes to make the flavor strong enough for me; in comparison to the dark sumatra and the six bean blend. Anyhow I think this is an excellent coffee bean, I have not tried it with drip coffee but the espressos are just excellent, again, for my palate (and my girlfriends apparently) not too bitter not to acid great aroma; which is a big part of the experience, (it doesn't cause me heartburn:-).

The flavor is pleasant and mild, not as strong as I like it, but good nonetheless. I ordered this City Roast to compensate for the milder flavor, but it isn't very dark. One reviewer said the beans were dark and oily, but the ones I got are just a little darker than non-dark-roast beans, with just a smidgen more sheen on them. They don't stick together in clumps at all like a French roast. And the flavor is just a little bit ""darker"" than regular beans (such as Dunkin' Donuts original). I found no downsides to the flavor (no bitterness, ""dustiness,"" or ""chemical"" aspects), but I just wish it was stronger. If you prefer a medium-mild flavor with just a hint of darkness, this is a good choice. (But the review that said the beans were oily suggests that the roasting might be a little inconsistent.) I liked it better than their Dark Brazilian, which also wasn't very dark, and which wasn't as pleasant overall."
564101,B002GWMCPG,A12NE4PW2EO4US,Jack Happens,1,5,3,1298764800,First Cup is 5 star,"These beans arrived having been very freshly roasted and with excellent aroma.  I brew in a French press and that first cup was excellent indeed- being a 5-star in flavor and at perhaps 4 on the aroma.  It did posses a rather surprising bitterness in the aftertaste but nothing that took anything significant away from the overall enjoyment.<br /><br />I have essentially finished the 5-pound bag now, and the enjoyment of that first cup continues at the same level as the first brew.  Unfortunately, my own style is to drink the coffee over the morning hours, and I normally do so by warming individual refills in the microwave.  After that  first excellent one, subsequent rewarmed  cups of this product, while a problem with many beans, drop off in quality faster than any other beans I have tried (of course, some start bad and stay bad). For that reason only- and admittedly my own habit that may not match yours- I drop this product to about 3 stars- it is a very steep drop in quality after that first cup.<br /><br />I have no idea how this might show itself using other brewing and serving methods.  I suspect that in any environment that does not require rewarming or perhaps held at temperature for longer periods, this is most definitely a 5-star candidate.  Its oiliness might possibly be a bit of a nuisance for some machines.<br /><br />Since I have found a few others that do hold their flavor extremely well after brewing and submit to rewarming quite well, I won't be using this one again.  If you are a re-warmer, I would try something else. However, I think that if you can avoid the heat cycling you should definitely consider giving in giving this one a try."

Price is not bad. You get 36 individual servings.<br /><br />This is a finer grind applesauce.  I really prefer it not so fine but love the flavor of this one.

Peanut butter that is not only low-cal and low-fat, but also organic - a dream come true! But, really, I couldn't justify spending $15 for a little jar. I was happily surprised to see this at a local grocery store chain called Reasor's. It was $7.29 for the little jar and I bought it.  If I see it on sale, I will buy all the jars.<br /><br />It tastes good like a very natural-tasting Jif. I like it stiffer so I use less water than the directions call for. Also, because of the lower fat content, it washes very easily. No more gross peanut butter knives in the sink!"

564125,B006UM6D94,A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8,Bill,0,0,5,1350000000,"Organic, tasty, and customizable","This product is great. Its got a few different ingredients than PB2 which are going to appeal to a big chunk of people in the health food community.<br /><br />PB2 is made with peanuts, sugar, and salt. This is made with organic peanuts, organic coconut sugar (which is supposed to have a lower glycemic index and for the record does not taste like coconut in the slightest), and sea-salt. I'm not certain how much the glycemic index of the sugar matters when it only has 2 grams of sugar per serving (PB2 has 1 gram), but then again I'm not diabetic and I thought it might be a useful thing to point out.<br /><br />Overall unless you are a strong subscriber to the ""Organic over Conventional"" debate I'm not sure this product is more nutritious than PB2. It has an extra gram of sugar and a gram less of protein and fiber per serving. Of course this is a huge improvement over normal organic peanut butter let alone peanut butter from any of the major brands. So if the two products are more or less the same nutrition wise purchasing would come down to flavor and price.<br /><br />This product is a bit more expensive than PB2. Thats probably due to the organic factor and scale. Organic ingredients cost more to produce and more to buy, but also PB2 has a jump start on branding and is in more stores (or at least it seems to be) so its distribution network may run more efficiently, it may be able to produce larger batches at lower costs, and overall its going to be a bit cheaper. So don't write this product off now and forever because of the price. If you try it and like it support it and the price may come down.<br /><br />Finally flavor and texture. This product tastes like peanut butter there's no getting around that. Its rich and almost creamy when you mix it up. It can add a peanut butter flavor to protein shakes, yogurt, muffins, cookies, etc. In short its fully customizable and how you use it is up to you and your preferences. I've read that a lot of people have to ""learn to like"" PB2. I didn't have that experience, but if you did or are having trouble learning to like it give this one a try. I'm not sure what it is exactly maybe the coconut sugar (which again doesn't taste like coconut), but it does taste a little different than PB2. I don't have much of a preference either way and friends that have tried both seem more or less split in their opinions (when they have one).<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br />It tastes great<br />It can be used in many ways and mixed to any consistency<br />It uses organic ingredients and coconut sugar (unlike PB2)<br />But its nutritional stats aren't quite as good (1 more gram sugar, 1 less gram fiber and protein)<br />Its a bit more expensive than PB2<br /><br />I love it, but you'll have to decide how you weight organic ingredients vs nutrition stats vs price, in any case if you want to replace your normal PB but don't like PB2 its worth a try"

For the multi-grian, I just add pureed pears, banana, etc with the pureed veggie to sweeten it up a bit (I get the Plum Baby purees for travel- another great way to ""hide"" the veggies-, or make purees at home in the blender & freeze).  This flavor cereal is not overly sweet at all (I've tasted it, since I wouldn't expect my son to eat anything I think is yucky-tasting).

I have tried making cappuccinos on both machines, and by far I prefer the Dolce Gusto. For my palate, it has a much more authentic cappuccino tast. I think that this is because the Dolce Gusto machine uses a high pressure, 15 bar system and the Tassimo does not. The Tassimo does make a delicious drip style coffee, especially from the Starbucks selections. I generally do not like sweetened coffee drinks, and again for me, the main difference between the Dolce Gusto ""Cappuccino"" and the ""Skinny Cappuccino"" seems to be the sweetner added to the milk capsule of the regular cappuccino.

Myers,2,2,5,1301616000,"My favorite, due to the calorie count...","Of all the coffee flavors available for the products with milk capsules (I must have milk), this is my coffee flavor of choice, due to the calorie count only.  I do not like all the sugar in these capsules, and this one has the lowest sugar content.  I guess I could just order the coffee flavors that don't come with milk and add my own, then I could add my favorite type of artificial sweetener, but the reason I purchased the machine was for the frothy hot milk, so I am settling for 50 calories and 5 sugars, since that's the lowest I could find at this time, but I can't offer it to my diabetic sister, due to the sugars.  I think it tastes great, but I do add a little more sweetener, since I am a sweet freak.  I noticed that the Nescafe company offers more capsule options in the UK, such as Skinny Latte Macchiato and Latte Macchiato Unsweetened options.  I hope those become available here, for those of us who would prefer no sugar added so we can add the sweetener we like, the amount we like, or no sugar at all.  If they would come out with milk capsules only in a box, I would try their coffees that contain no milks, but they don't seem to want to do that so far.  Even the UK, which seems to get things before we do, doesn't have that option.  If I were to drink any of their flavors, based solely on it's flavor, I really enjoy the Mocha capsules over the Skinny Cappuccino, but there's a lot of sugar in those.  I have a diabetic sister who drinks coffees with me quite often, and I would buy the plain coffee choices for her that contain no sugar if I had the milk capsules to offer her that frothy goodness.  I think they would have much higher sales if they allowed us to decide if we want our coffees sweet and/or milky or not."

I no longer have any regular beans in my pantry so I can't compare for you.<br /><br />Also, Eden Foods has a custom can lining that has NO bisphenol-A (I believe they are the only canning company which has done this), so that's another really good reason to get these beans.

Why?,"All beans are moderately high in antioxidants (and calories) but soybeans are the healthiest beans we can eat because:  (1)Soybeans contain phytoestrogens called, ""soy isoflavones"" (genistein, daidzein, and glycitein), which have been shown to substantially reduce the risk of developing heart disease, stroke, numerous cancers, and bone fractures.  (2)Soy protein is the only plant-source protein that comes close to matching the quality of animal-source proteins.  The deficiency-critical amino acids, methionine, lysine, and phenylalanine are much more plentiful in soy protein than in any other plant-source protein including proteins from all other beans.  (3)Soybeans are rich in virtually every mineral listed on the label of a complete multi-vitamin or complete multi-mineral tablet.  (4)Soybean oil contains alpha-linolenic acid, a slightly beneficial short-chain omega-3 fatty acid.  Although canned soybeans are healthier for us to eat than all other canned beans, they are not as healthy to eat as the Japanese fermented soybean food called, ""natto,"" which contains very generous amounts of nattokinase, vitamin K2/MK-7, vitamin K2/MK-8, vitamin PQQ, and vitamin C (manufactured by the friendly bacteria, not the plant) in addition to soy isoflavones.  This Eden Organic Black Soybean product contains 140mg of soy isoflavones per can.  Eating 1 can per day will be more than enough to give us the maximum benefit from soy isoflavones.  Eden adds a small quantity of ""kombu,"" a delicious Japanese seaweed, into each can.  This adds a small amount of sodium.  Total sodium:  105mg per can.  A person on a salt-restricted diet might object to this (and give this product only 3 stars) but I don't mind because kombu is high in fucoidan, a very beneficial polysaccharide."

I also think the rose flavor that was added interferes with the normal green tea flavor. This DOES however taste better than unsweetened bottled tea in America, and perhaps better than most common green tea bags you can find. It's not bitter and slightly sweet just like normal Ito En's tea. So, in the end, I will still finish up this 12 pack but I most likely won't buy this flavor again.<br /><br />Note that I've only drank one bottle so far, my opinion of this flavor might change over time - I'll edit this review when I've finished the 12 pack.<br /><br />My favorite flavors so far:<br /><br />Original Oi Ocha<br /><br />Jasmine Green tea<br />- Very nice smell, this is what I'd originally expected from the rose...<br />- Original Ito En and Tea's Tea seems to have a different flavor. The Original has a much better smell and is recommended. The Tea's Tea has a weaker smell but is still very nice.<br /><br />Green tea blueberry<br />- Sweetened.

I was not yet in high school in the early 80s and the sweet, tangy taste was a salve that help take my mind off homework, bullies and girls. After bus dropped me off at school, I'd run up the hill to the candy truck and buy a box or two. The grape and strawberry where the originals and my all time favorite. Eaten one at a time or in an overwhelming mouthful, I just loved 'em.<br /><br />Nerds were the ""Candy of the Year"" in 1985. They're thickly glazed with carnauba wax that gives them their hard crunch, and a flavored gloss. The center of each candy is composed of one or more complete, tangy sucrose crystals. If you were patient enough to let the coating dissolve in your mouth, then you could take it out and see that the crystals were clear. I was rarely so self retrained though, and would usually suck on their fun texture for a little while then just crunch away.<br /><br />The box has two openings at the top, one for each flavor. It was always a mystery which side I'd finish first, since I went back and forth between the two.

Because of the longer processing time, pu-erhs are generally more expensive, so this isn't a bad price for pu-erh, although it is a little pricey for tea.<br /><br />This is good pu-erh for other reasons:  unless you have a tea diffuser, you can't make pu-erh teas--they're not generally sold in bags.

To the point that you would use no more than a tiny cap full (or less than a cap full) for 1/2 cup of popcorn. I strongly advise putting a very small amount on first (before you pop the popcorn kernals), then add later in your 2nd batch, and slowly add more. I added a little of this and it was too salty.<br /><br />I added less on the 2nd batch, and it was perfect, and yellow color! Use coconut oil with this, and you can't tell the difference from home/movie theater popcorn.<br /><br />I do advise this! Just remember, use very little.

I guess I attribute that to the freshness of the tea. I'm not sure. I've had a lot different results with loose tea in a ball and some herbal teas. While this tastes good when you get it right, if you forget the cup for a few minutes, it's not forgiving. That said, that's the only real drawback to this tea. Yes. I've had teas I would rate five stars, six if I could. Yes, they also cost 5-6x more than this easily for a quarter of the amount of tea.

Pop Rocks didn't kill Mikey.  Mixing Pop Rocks and soda won't lead to exploding child, although s/he might burp something wicked (but burping's kind of fun when you're young enough to be amused by it.  Or if you're male).<br /><br />Pop Rocks aren't about the flavors, much.  As long as they taste like sugar - and they still do - that's good enough, because Pop Rocks are all about the pop - and they still do that, too.  One attraction is surely opening your mouth wide, with food inside (!), so you and your friends can listen to the noise unhindered.  Close your mouth and get the full impact, because you can actually feel the popping.<br /><br />Some things, the small amusements in life, never change, although 1983 began a bleak period in the lives of Pop Rocks fans when they disappeared from store shelves.  1985 brought them back as ""Action Candy"", but we all knew.  It's been good to have them back under their proper name, because no childhood can possibly be complete until you've had your friends listen to your mouth.<br /><br />Blue Raspberry's not a bad flavor, but the ""Dips"" part is a little deceptive, if you take the package at face value.  The sucker looks huge, and it isn't.  It's thinner than you think, and way smaller than the picture on the packaging suggests.  Not that a seven year old is going to complain or even notice.  The only negative is that, like many fun foods (junk foods, snack foods), the packaging is mostly empty.

A little over a year ago, I happened across the ""Wabash Valley Farms 25008 Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper"" here on Amazon.  Very cool gadget, let me tell ya!  Since then, I've been on a quest for the perfect popcorn to compliment the Whirley Pop.  As I get older, I'm beginning to appreciate the more ""natural"" popcorn varieties, and I suppose that's what attracted me to the Arrowhead Mills Organic Yellow Popcorn.<br /><br />I'm no ""organic"" food expert.  I just wanted some good tasting popcorn.  And, I feel like that's what I got.  Using the Whirley Pop, with a very small amount of oil, I've had great results.  I was concerned by some of the reviews stating they were seeing a substantial number of unpopped kernels.  This hasn't been my experience to-date.  I'd say the pop-rate is on par or better than any other variety of corn I've tried.<br /><br />As for taste, it tastes like what you'd think ""plain"" popcorn should taste like.  Light, fluffy, and very good.  I think, perhaps, a lot of folks associate ""natural"" popcorn with air-popped popcorn, and I don't know that that's a fair comparison.  Air-popped popcorn has always tasted sort of...rubbery, to me.  Using the Whirly-pop, you still get that great popcorn ""CRUNCH"", but without the extra fat, salt, and who know's what is added to microwave popcorns.<br /><br />Perhaps that's the beauty of Arrowhead Mills popcorn.  All natural out of the box.  The sky is the limit when it comes to ""fancying"" it up.  Want butter, and salt?  No problem!  Prefer your popcorn plain?  Easy as pie.  The point is, you are in total control of what, if anything, is added to your popcorn.  As someone who likes to occasionally indulge in some *real* butter on my popcorn, this is a nice change of pace as compared to the sickly ""butter"" that many big-name manufactures use.<br /><br />Give this stuff a try.  For the money, I think it's a good, healthy choice."

This popcorn never fails to pop, and you get a very large bowl of it (we used to only get a few handfuls with the store bought brands).  If you love popcorn without all the calories, this is the stuff to get!"

Like other reviewers, we have had a problem with bags opening during shipment, and have talked to Customer Service about it.  Our last order came in better packaging and all six bags were intact.<br /><br />There is some inconsistency in quality, but we have never had a truly bad batch.  All of the bags were within ""best by"" dates, so can only guess as to the reason.<br /><br />We've popped this popcorn in several different types of poppers:<br /><br />Microwave, using a Presto microwave popper (with the somewhat hard-to-get concentrators).  Pops up very well but does leave quite a few unpopped.  Let those settle to the bottom of the bowl and enjoy the rest.  Do need to be careful near the end of the batch - dentists love unpopped popcorn.<br /><br />Stovetop, using a WhirlyPop.  Pops very well in the aluminum ones.  Only problems have been with the Whirlypop and a tendency for popped kernels to get stuck under the stiring rod and burn.<br /><br />In an electric popper (another Presto, but the West Bend should work fine too).  Excellent results here - almost all pop and taste great.  Must confess to using a little more oil than the manufacturer recommends.<br /><br />In summary, this is a very good organic popcorn.  It is as good or better than the other organic popcorns we've tried (better than most) and quite reasonably priced with the subscription."

As you may know, corn in general is LOADED with pesticides.<br />In addition, Monsanto is destroying the world with their GMO products which makes their corn resistant to the pesticide (also made by Monsanto) called Round-up. So once their corn is planted, it can be drenched in Round-up to kill the weeds and the corn still grows. I don't want to be consuming Round-up when I eat.  Nice huh? Sorry for the sidetrack.  Just sayin.  My point is, it was critical for me that the popcorn be organic for me to even eat any corn period.  This popcorn is not only delicious, it is at an outstanding price of less than $1.45 a pound.  With this purchase, you get 10.5 pounds of popcorn.  I couldn't find a cheaper organic popcorn than this one.  If somebody does, please contact me.  Once last thing, use Organic Coconut Oil if you want an extra healthy treat.  Coconut oil handles the high heat necessary in making popcorn and is also extremely healthy for you. Tastes great. Don't even need butter."

I used about a teaspoon of coconut oil with about 1/2 cup of popcorn, and made it in the plastic microwave popper sold here on Amazon.  Just that 1/2 cup made a gigantic bowl of popcorn that was probably twice the amount you get in the typical microwave bags.  It makes you realize with a slap in the face how much you've been paying for so long, to get so little!  Doing it this way takes only about two minutes longer than the convenient bags, but you get twice as much at a very small fraction of the price!!<br /><br />Honestly, I am not wild about the coconut oil on the popcorn.  I will probably continue to use it, because of the health benefits of coconut oil, and maybe I'll get used to it in a short time.  If not, I'll consider using nothing or perhaps canola oil or light olive oil.  I just don't know if I can get used to that slightly coconut-y flavor on the popcorn.  And it does add a slight oily-ness too, that I'm not crazy about.  I like my popcorn dry and unsalted, or sometimes with just a tiny bit of sea salt.  If I find, as some have stated in reviews, that a little oil is necessary to get good pops, then perhaps I will spring for a jar of ghee in my local healthfood store. (For those who aren't familiar with ghee, it is clarified butter... they skim off the solids once the butter is melted.  It has a higher smoke point and is loaded with fat!  It is also pretty expensive, although you could make it yourself at home.)  At least the slight oily-ness would have a buttery flavor instead of one that really doesn't complement the popcorn, in my opinion.  I'm sure you could make an entire bowl of popcorn with about 1/8 of a teaspoon of ghee, so the high price and high fat content might be worth the taste.<br /><br />There were some unpopped kernels in the bottom of the bowl, but honestly not that many.  There weren't any ""half-popped"" ~ which I find yummy but they're probably not good for my digestive tract anyway, so I won't miss them.  If you compared the number of unpopped kernels in my bowl to what you'd find in two bags of commercial microwave popcorn, it would probably be about the same.  So I have nothing to complain about.<br /><br />The popcorn was yummy, and now that I have a truly organic, salt free, low fat snack that's full of fiber, I will be eating popcorn a lot more often.  I have stocked up on it, and when it's gone I'll stock up again.  I'd better be sure to also stock up on dental floss, otherwise my dentist might not be too happy with me at my next cleaning appointment.<br /><br />Thumbs up!!!<br />(Slight warning on the plastic microwave bowl though... it gets EXTREMELY hot and stays hot for a while after you take it out of the microwave!  Use potholders to hold it, or you'll burn your hands like I did... I expected it to have cooled down a bit, but no...)<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004W4UP"">Nordic Ware 60120 Microwaver Popcorn Popper 12 Cup</a><br /><br />Addition January 2012:  I just ordered my second half dozen batch.  I finally figured out the perfect way to make this popcorn, and it has become a staple snack.  I keep the coconut in the fridge, and use a knife to shave off a few pieces to pop a bowl.  Perfect combo is 1/3 cup corn and a few shavings of oil... perfect bowl of popped corn!  The teaspoon I was using in the beginning was too much... that was why my batch was oily and too ""coconutty"" at first.  Just a few shavings is plenty to pop it, and gives it just a very slight coconut taste (which is delicious)."

Oh, and I also learned how to make it in the micro using lunch size paper bags. I squirt a quick spray of oil canola  in the bag, put in about a 1/4 cup corn kernels, roll the edge about three times and cook it on high for about three minutes.  I don't have children in the house but it's got to be safer than letting make it on a burner, especially when you're not watching.

If a manufacturer had nothing to hide, they would list the specific animal that makes up the meat content. Plus, the meat is marked ""by-products"", which is throwaway parts unusable for anything else and of the lowest quality in nutrients. Wheat, corn, and soy are also part of the ingredient list and among the worst offenders when it comes to allergies in dogs. They are among the most difficult things for dogs to digest.

One evening, the owners of the inn prepared a dinner for the guests that included lemon chicken and parmisan risotto. While the chicken was delicious, I fell in love with the creamy yet meaty texture and delicate flavor of the risotto, a perfect accompaniment, and attempted without success to duplicate this dish at home. Recently we began switching to organic and natural foods, and made our first box of Lundberg Organic Parmisan Risotto. I was taken back to that lovely inn with the first delectible bite! I was so amazed that the rich flavor and texture of a homecooked dish could come from a box! This risotto is ideal with so many main courses - chicken, fish, Italian meat dishes - and can also be the foundation of a hearty vegan dish with added vegetables and nuts.

I was excited to see that Earth's best made Stage 3 foods.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this Particular Stage 3 option (Earth's Best Junior Baby Food Organic Chunky Orchard Fruit, 6-Ounce Jars) is not Stage 3 quality. It is very thin comparable to the Stage 2 food. It does have a few small tiny tiny pieces of fruit in it but nothing compared to the other stage 3 thicknesses. Seeing as my twins are used to have bigger thicker pieces of food they eat the food off the spoon so quickly.<br />As with all Earth's best I love the quality of the food and my twins love the taste.

Unfortunately, the ingredients did not mention that there are RAISINS in this product. The combination of apples, raisins and cinnamon is not a good idea at all. My baby actually started gagging when I put a spoonful in her mouth. When I tasted it myself, I felt like doing the same. This mixture is just too sweet because of the raisins. There is also a very strong flavor of cinnamon. I usually add some cinnamon to the food she eats so I know that she likes cinnamon if its in a normal quantity. I tried diluting the flavor in several ways, but it's no use. The cinnamon flavor was still too strong. I still have about 8 more jars to experiment with. I'm thinking I'll give it one more try by mixing apple puree with a little bit of this mixture and see if the baby will take it or not. Otherwise, it's all going in the trash.

I purchased this based on users' positive reviews and my bag of beans are NOT fresh at all. The last bag of whole beans I purchased was from Costco and when I first opened that bag, the smell of sweet coffee aroma was overwhelming (in a good way). With the Eight O'clock beans, you have you put your nose really close and practically into the bag to smell coffee fragrance. The beans look to be dried out and stale (and some beans roasted to a black burntness). It's possible that maybe my bag is a dud or maybe there was a small hole that caused the beans to dry out before it's arrival. This is my 3rd coffee bean purchase from Amazon and it is a real disappointment. I'm tempted to call the company's toll free number to complain but figure they probably can't do much than give me more of this crappy coffee.<br /><br />I'll admit...I'm sitting here in the morning with a freshly brewed cup of this coffee, but with each unsatisfied sip, I'm get frownier by the minute.

564655,B003GV7JFE,AS1M88N4CKRJA,Thomas P. Mcfarland,1,6,3,1338336000,"Not terrible, but I won't buy it again","OK, first thing first. This coffee is cheap- around $6 per pound, shipped. Until I tried this, nearly all coffee I'd bought was between two and four times as expensive. Keep that in mind while reading this review.<br /><br />If you are a poor coffee snob, don't get this. If you are just looking for a good value in coffee and don't have very high standards for coffee, this might be acceptable.<br /><br />I drink coffee every day, and I take a fair bit of effort to prepare it well (Hario V-60, french press, or clever), I don't ever brew large pots of drip coffee. By general standards, it is probably fair to call me a coffee snob; by local Seattle standards, not so much. That said, I'm not going to go on about tasting notes, undertones, overtones, etc. etc. etc. I like some light roasts, some medium roasts, some dark roasts, but I'm not much of a taste-tester- when I taste coffee I can tell right away whether I like it or don't like it, but I can't pick out subtle flavor profiles and can't necessarily tell why I like or dislike it. My immediate impression of this coffee was that it tastes a little bit bland, a little bit burnt, and not very good, but I'm not going to expand on that.<br /><br />Important caveat: This review is intended for people who have the time, patience, and interest to brew coffee with a reasonable level of care. The best coffee in the world is rendered mediocre without careful brewing. If you are using an electric drip brewer, you probably shouldn't be spending more than $6/lb on coffee, ever. *<br /><br />If you use an electric brewer to make your pot of coffee in the morning, my recommendation is to buy this coffee because it is good value and will be nearly indiscernible from much more expensive coffee (and stock up on cream and sugar to mask the flavor of old coffee that your brewer imparts on every cup). If you take a reasonable amount of care in preparing coffee, read on (but you probably shouldn't buy this).<br /><br />Depending on how frugal and lazy I'm feeling when my coffee runs out I typically get whole bean bulk coffee from a local upscale grocery store at around $12/lb, try one of the local coffee roasters at around $15-20/lb (I live in Seattle, there are a lot to choose from), or try to roast my own beans (which comes out to about $8/lb but results range from bad to acceptible). Before moving to Seattle I'd usually buy whole bean coffee from starbucks at around $15/lb. I tried this coffee because I am currently pretty short on cash and figured cheaper coffee was a good way to save money.<br /><br />So, the eight oclock original bean is... alright. The coffee I was getting at the local supermarket and pretty much all of the local roasters is much, much better. Pretty much every Starbucks roast I've tried is considerably better. For about the same price I was (usually) getting better coffee by roasting at home (although this does add time and effort).<br /><br />Overall quality is about 2 stars, value is about 4 stars, I'd say that averages out to three stars. If your expectations are sufficiently low, you won't be disappointed and might be impressed, it isn't nearly as bad as a can of pre-ground Folgers that someone once gave me (that was really, truly, horrible).<br /><br />Prepared in a v-60, this coffee is drinkable, and I'll probably drink all three pounds instead of throwing it away, but I won't be buying again. I always drink black coffee, but I might sometimes add cream to this. In the future, for about the same amount of money, I'll stick with home-roasting (a bit of a hassle, and results vary a lot for me, but usually better than this). Starbucks is better; most small-scale roasters I've tried are much better, but these are more expensive, whether it is worth it or not is really up to you.<br /><br />* note on electric drip coffee machines:<br />Maybe there are good electrical drip machines, I don't know, I just know that I've never had a good cup of coffee from one. If you love coffee and always use an electrical drip machine and yours makes the best coffee in the world, that's cool, I'm not trying to insult or question your judgement. I've had $50/lb Kona coffee out of an electrical drip machine, it was lousy (the same coffee made ""cowboy-style"" in a pyrex measuring bowl and filtered through a paper towel was great.)"

They offer a decent amount of nutrition for such a small amount of food and the ingredients are mostly wholesome. Combined with a small amount of milk or other beverage to wash them down, they make a great way to start the day. I also like the sweet, grainy taste and the chewy texture, which is better than some of the crunchy granola bars that can often be a chore to consumer.<br /><br />Even though I like Quaker Chewy Granola Bars Chocolate Chip very much, there are a few possible drawbacks with these granola bars. The first one is the fact that they are not very filling. If you don't plan on eating lunch for a long time afterward, then you might want to reconsider Quaker Chewy Granola Bars Chocolate Chip because they are likely to result in a growling stomach in a relatively short time. The reason is because they lack sufficient fat and calories to keep you going for very long. The other potential drawback is the addition of high fructose corn syrup in the manufacturing of this product.<br /><br />If you are worried about budgetary restrictions, you will be pleased with Quaker Chewy Granola Bars Chocolate Chip. These bars are not very expensive and the surprising fact is that, compared to other granola bars, they often rank in the bottom half in terms of overall cost. This is surprising when you consider that they carry the Quaker label. A premium, quality name like Quaker should, one would assume, carry a premium price. But Quaker has managed to keep costs under control and it offers these granola bars for a price that is lower than most other name brands.<br /><br />Granola bars will likely remain part of my daily eating routine and Quaker Chewy Granola Bars Chocolate Chip rank among my favorite breakfast bars. The ingredients are a little worrisome, and the carbohydrate level is too great for those on low- carb diets. But these are still very tasty bars and they are priced right."

Then look no further than this popcorn party kit!<br /><br />I purchased this popcorn as a side item when I found and purchased an at-home ""authentic"" popcorn machine on Amzaon.  Unfortunately, the popcorn machine that I ordered during the same transaction (from a different Amazon seller than Wabash) had been discontinued; however, I received this popcorn kit from Wabash within a mater of days.<br /><br />Here I was, stuck with this popcorn kit and no popcorn machine in which to pop it.  The only way I knew how to pop popcorn was in a microwave.  So I got out a covered, 6-qt sauce aluminum sauce pan (part of a 13-pc Calphalon cookware set I bought a couple years ago at B, B, & Beyond), followed the cooking instruction for ""stovetop"" popping on the back of the popcorn package, and poured the package's contents into the pan.<br /><br />The results were INCREDIBLE!  The scent of movie theater popcorn filled the air of my condo, and the entire sauce pan was filled to the top with buttery popcorn.  It was actually pretty cool, too, watching the popcorn pop through the glass lid lol  We poured it out into a popcorn bowl, sprinkled a little bit of Wabash's Popcorn Salt <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00017LF24"">Popcorn Salt</a>, and my wife and I couldn't believe how authentic this popcorn tasted (on a separate note, this salt tastes GREAT on things like french fries and tater tots).  Nearly every kernel popped fully and perfectly, and nearly every piece was nicely coated in just the right amount of yellow, melted butter and oil.  We then sat down and watched ""Batman Begins"" - we weren't even past the first five minutes when we had finished off the entire, huge batch of popcorn and were making more!!<br /><br />We didn't use the paper popcorn cups because we didn't want to waste them on just us, but they're definitely a nice novelty and add to that authentic, movie-theater feeling.<br /><br />We've had a few guests over for movie night at our home, and our guests agree that this is great tasting popcorn.<br /><br />This Popcorn Party Kit is a MUST HAVE!

It is a very finely ground salt that adheres to the moisture in the popcorn when it is freshly popped or adheres to cold popcorn due to the crevices in the popped corn. With nuts it also adheres wonderfully when the nuts are fresh out of the oven after toasting them.

This extract has been very easy to use - about 6cc per liter of seltzer. I've gotten lots of compliments on the taste of the lime-infused seltzer and I'm no longer throwing out perfectly good bottles after just one use.<br /><br />The shipment from JR Mushrooms was prompt... two bottles arrived in a well-padded box with lots of bubble-wrap and foam peanuts to keep them safe and sound. The bottles themselves are dark brown glass (presumably to shield the juice from the sun) and have well-fitting plastics caps. All in all, I was very happy with this purchase and the quality of the product, as of July 2009.<br /><br />Recently (August 2010 - that is how long the initial 32 oz order of the old extract lasted), I ordered another set of extract. Sadly, the supplier of extract to JRMushroom has changed and so has the formulation - the extract now arrives in a clear plastic bottle, not the dark brown glass bottle of 2009. I am not convinced that the present version if terpeneless, as there is a fairly bitter aftertaste. Amit at OliveNation/JRMushrooms was very nice to refund the unopened bottle (I had bought 2) and also informed me that he is negotiating a new supplier for the stuff.<br /><br />So here is what I suggest for any extract order over the internet: Order a small sample bottle ($6.5) and make sure it fits your flavor expectations before ordering a larger bottle. Plus, before you re-order, contact the seller and make sure that the flavor/supplier hasn't changed. I am a bit disappointed that Amit has not updated the Amazon web pages to reflect the new packaging, which would have been a good clue not to go ahead with a large-bottle purchase but to sample the present product first.

The food products are nested in shredded brown paper.  Overall it's a very natural and quaint presentation.  The shredded paper left some dust on the spice bottle and at first I thought it was dirt since it was brown, but then I realized....<br /><br />I have often cooked with quinoa and lentils and mung beans and Bragg's Liquid Aminos, but the sprouted lentils and beans were a new experience for me, as was the spice shaker.  Oh my goodness those spices were so tasty.  My nine-year-old daughter selected one of the four recipes that were included.  I was like, ""Meh, I've cooked all of this before... whatever...""  But the recipe we made-- Quinoa and Sweet Potato Cakes--was entirely new to me.  It was so good.  Like Thanksgiving all in one patty.  So there's these four recipes included, and they all use most of the ingredients in the box--just add fresh veggies.  The sprouted beans cook up in just five minutes, which is pretty amazing to me as a veteran bean cooker.  In my opinion, sprouted beans taste stronger than standard beans, and not very good on their own, but with the two Bragg's ingredients in the box, and the excellent recipes (well, I only tried one), the beans are perfectly balanced.  We had a delicious dinner.  My 6-year-old finished her plate of food and was going for more before we had even served up everyone's food and said the prayer.  Little rascal.  But anyway, if kids think it's good, you know it's good.<br /><br />All of the recipes are vegan and gluten-free, as are all the ingredients in the box.  All organic, too.  Also included in the box was a pamphlet about how to start on a healthy diet.<br /><br />Another reviewer commented that the quinoa instructions should say that quinoa must be washed first.  I noticed that too, and it's true that quinoa should always be washed before cooking, so I looked for any such instruction, but then I noticed that the package says the quinoa is thoroughly washed.  Why isn't quinoa always sold that way?  I cooked it without washing it.  It was good, clean.<br /><br />I think this is a great combo pack, very simple and straightforward ingredients and recipes.  As soon as I opened it I was thinking of the many people I would like to see on a healthier diet, and I'm guessing that's what this box is intended for... those of us who do eat a whole foods diet and hope to win our friends over with a nifty gift.

I have a lot of quinoa at home and you always have to wash it first to remove the saponins (soap like film).<br /><br />I would have rated this package 5 stars because the idea, recipe cards and three grains/beans enclosed are great.  However, there are two main reasons that caused me to rate this 4 stars. First, the products supplied can be purchased separately for about $23 retail--of course without the recipe cards which is a nice touch.  Second, the box it comes in is too big.  I think Whole Foods wants to give the impression that you are getting a lot for the price but it's really a waste of cardboard.  If this package were priced between $30 and $32 and came in a smaller box more suitable to the items enclosed, I would have rated this five stars.

I suggested my friend send her this, along with a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CVTT52"">rice cooker</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006IUXU"">hot pot</a>.

I'm new to sprouted mung beans and the liquid aminos and seasoning.  I've had a week of fast and easy lunches with this kit, and this is what I've noticed so far:<br /><br />Quinoa: Oh, man, I am getting spoiled.  I love quinoa but hate to have to rinse it.  This quinoa is pre-rinsed, so it goes straight into the pot.  I've always cooked it for 10 minutes, though the package says 15.  10 seems to be just fine for this quinoa, too.  It also seems to be fluffier than my usual quinoa.  The flavor is the same, which is to say, not much, so it works well to replace rice.  I add it to soups or chill it to add to salads.  I've also had it for breakfast instead of oatmeal.  1/4 cup dry (about 1/2 cup cooked) has 5g of protein, so I'm not looking for a mid-morning snack after having this for breakfast.<br /><br />Lentils: I sauteed some onion, added broth and a half cup of lentils, then added a good pinch of seasoning.  20 minutes after I started chopping the onion I had a really great lentil soup.  Since I don't cook with salt I sprayed a little of the liquid aminos over the top.  Best lentils I've had in a long time.<br /><br />Mung beans: The first time I made lentil soup with this kit I figured I'd throw in some mung beans. That was a mistake--the mung beans have a stronger flavor and they completely overwhelmed the lentils.  I ended up with a soup with a nutty flavor, and it wasn't as thick as I expected.  It wasn't lentil soup, but it was very good.  Since then I mostly cook and chill these to add to salads.  The instructions say 3 cups water to 1 cup mung beans, but 3 cups left me with a lot of water to pour off.  A 2 to 1 ratio seems to be about right.<br /><br />Liquid Aminos: I just tasted a bit of soy sauce then a bit of Liquid Aminos.  (I don't recommend that, by the way.)  They taste about the same.  My soy sauce has a preservative, and there's no preservative in the Liquid Aminos.  Otherwise I'm not sure what the difference is.  The spray bottle is handy.  I'd use them interchangeably.<br /><br />Bragg Organic Sprinkle: A nice seasoning mix.  I've been using it in soups and on chicken.  I'll have to try it on popcorn.<br /><br />The kit comes with four recipes, but to be honest I haven't tried any of them.  I keep a fairly well-stocked kitchen, but I was missing ingredients from every recipe.  I'm looking forward to trying them (especially the Quinoa and Sweet Potato Cakes,) but it would be nice to see a few recipes with ingredients most people will have on hand.<br /><br />I really like this kit, and while I do find it expensive, I'd happily give it as a gift to someone who wants to take their cooking in this direction."

She always has difficulty finding foods that fit her lifestyle, and holiday gatherings are especially trying times for her. I think she'll appreciate having a variety of delicious all organic, gluten-free, and vegan friendly grains and seasonings at her fingertips. Hopefully she will whip up a couple of the included recipes as part of Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow! I'm looking forward to sampling some of whatever she makes.<br /><br />My gift box arrived double boxed in perfect condition. The box and contents are exactly as shown in the product photos on the Amazon webpage. The gift box is sealed with kraft tape. I imagine this is both to keep it closed safely during transit, and to act as a tamper evident seal. I opened it up to make sure everything had arrived safely - which it had. The interior of the box has a nice double flap, and generous amounts of crinkle-shredded kraft paper, to protect the contents. Most everything is easily recyclable except the 3 plastic bags containing the grains. The expiration dates on the products are clearly marked and all are well into late 2012 or 2013 - so everything is nice and fresh.<br /><br />Overall a very nice gift for the healthy eater on your gift list!"

This store has the worst service I have had the displeasure of experiencing in a long time. (I'm sorry it had to be said LOL.) As for this product, I loved the gift basket, it was a perfect gift for my Vegan buddies. The quinoa sweet potato cakes were fabulous. My packages arrived ahead of time and were in perfect condition thankfully for a gift. The 3 stars is only because box is fairly small but all in all a great deal in my opinion."

I like beans and spices and thought I'd like this ensemble.<br /><br />I did like the packaging. It comes in a box that opens easily and it feels like a nice assortment to receive as a gift. Though I agree with others that it could use something else - a sweet or something to make it more special than just beans/grains and flavorings.<br /><br />It comes with several recipe cards.  I also liked this idea, that the recipient can use the ingredients to make something right away (though some fresh veggies are needed in addition to what is in the box).<br /><br />I tried one recipe - the quinoa sweet potato cakes, and wasn't impressed. The amount of chili powder called for made them so spicy I could barely eat them. I definitely couldn't serve them to my kids.  Even with less chili powder, I think they would have been just mediocre.  None of the other recipes looked appealing to me.<br /><br />So now I just have a few bags of beans and flavorings waiting for another use.<br /><br />I'd give this product a good rating for the packaging and the concept.

The Braggs Liquid aminos is an excellent alternative to soy sauce (without all the extra salt) and have used it twice for the base of delicious marinades on seafood, along with garlic and ginger.  The Braggs organic seasoning is very tasty on mixed vegetables to kick them up a notch, or sprinkled on potatoes.  Just watch out with how much you are using if you have high blood pressure or are watching your sodium intake.  The quinoa was very fresh and nutty tasting, and I liked the fact that it is pre-washed, saving an arduous step in cooking quinoa.  Makes it a very easy and healthy side dish to include with any main dish."

I've tried two of them, and they're tasty -- but I did add a little olive oil instead of going with their oil-less cooking instructions.<br /><br />You don't have to be a vegetarian to enjoy these meals as-is, and you can certainly add some meats of your choice if desired.<br /><br />The reason I'd be disappointed at full price is there's just not that much to this box -- the lentils, quinoa, and mung beans will be gone after 2 to 3 recipes' worth of each at best.  The liquid aminos (quite similar to soy sauce!) and the seasoning blend will at least last for awhile, and they're not something I'd typically buy myself, so I welcomed the opportunity to try them.  They certainly added a more complex flavor to the dishes.<br /><br />I did not wash the quinoa first, as that wasn't specified in the directions, and it came out just fine -- even my husband, who has not often been exposed to such things, enjoyed it!"

At the time I ordered, I didn't pay much attention to the packaging and the other items in the set -- until it arrived.  What a surprise to find these simple, basic items packaged so attractively along with recipes and condiments that made trying the sprouted beans a pleasure instead of a challenge.  The mung beans are terrific.  The Bragg Liquid Aminos add depth to whatever food you spray them on.  The Bragg Organic 24 Herbs & Spices Sprinkle Seasoning is wonderfully balanced and not unlike an herb mix I have been making myself for years.

I have long hair, and a lot of my clothing does not involve synthetic fibers.  Having prepared some of this for dinner, I am drinking organic, fair-trade coffee with gluten-free almond milk and agave nectar, as I write this.<br /><br />But, mmm...no.<br /><br />See here is the thing.  This is mung beans, sprouted lentils, and quinoa.  It's also ""Bragg's Amino Acids"" and a spice mixture that doesn't say ""gluten-free"" on the label.<br /><br />As for taste, this isn't ideal:<br /><br />Bragg's is a very acquired taste.  Even after a decade of being vegetarian and thirteen years of being gluten-free after that, I still don't like the stuff--and unless you're sure that your recipient thinks it's good stuff, you're going to get an ""eeewww"" on your Hanukah or Christmas present.<br /><br />This is also a gluten-free fail:<br /><br />The quinoa, mung beans and sprouted lentils are all good, and it's merciful that they are marked gluten-free, because sometimes it's difficult to know how things are processed, and if they are gluten-free.  But, then the spice mixture doesn't say it's gluten-free--which means it's probably not, and that's kind of annoying.<br /><br />Even drinking my fair-trade coffee out of an Ikea mug, I'm still a little stumped as to who would think this is just nifty.  I felt sacrilegious adding canned spinach to the first cooking attempt--the enclosed recipes call for things like cilantro, which is not something one tends to have sitting around the house in the dead of winter, even in Austin.<br /><br />So, it's good food, but it fails as to practicality and gluten-freeness.

This was a good candidate since it has a 10+ year shelf storage life.  I normally eat turkey bacon, so wanted to see how this would substitute.  The bacon slices are very thin and pre-cooked.  When I pulled the bacon from the can, I noticed there was a lot of fat, so you have to wash your hands after handling .  I sandwiched 7 slices of bacon between paper towels and microwaved for 60 seconds.  The end result was crisp, lean, thin, and tasty slices of bacon.  Expensive, but a good product to add to my long term food storage.  I would only use this product in an emergency situation and for that purpose, give this product a 5 star rating."

Each layer of wax paper has 12 or so slices on it, they are thin, not paper thin, but don't expect thick cut slab bacon either. These are supposed to be fully cooked, but I like my bacon crunchier.<br /><br />I found I liked this bacon best in BLT sandwiches after cooking the bacon almost 2 minutes in the microwave on a paper towel just to warm it up and get it crispy. I'd cut the cooking time to 30 seconds or a minute until you have your microwave dialed in.<br /><br />Obviously if there is an emergency and you're cooking over a flame, you'll want to be careful not to overcook these when warming them up.<br /><br />Last thing for you folks out there, my wife liked it, food storage products are hit or miss with her.

Since they were stocked at my local natural foods co-op and claimed to be ""natural"" I just assumed that they would come from GMO free corn.  It was not until I read the Cornucopia Institute's ""Cereal Crimes"" report that I read about so called ""natural"" cereals containing plenty of GMO's and pesticide residues, and often at a higher price than the organics.  Most of Barbara's Bakery's cereals are not organic so I looked a little closer at the ingredients on these cheese puffs too and realized that if we had wanted GMO's and pesticides just about any brand would have been fine.  I do admit though that Barbara's have a good taste.<br /><br />  ""Natural"" is a worthless title.  Best to stick with USDA certified organics.  I am switching to the Little Bear original baked cheese puffs instead. I didn't care for their Lite Cheese Puffs but he Baked are good.  Amazon has them at a reasonable price.

Totally, I have had ~7 different brands of turkey jerky and ~8 of the beef variety .  Among turkey, Oberto is my favorite by far.<br /><br />Given that jerky is made by a dehydration process, dryness is inherent to jerky as a food.  Also, turkey is a dryer meat than beef (the most common jerky) and I've found turkey jerky to be, on average, dryer than beef jerky.  I prefer my jerky relatively moist.<br /><br />Oberto Turkey Jerky is by far the most moist jerky I've had (aside from the Oberto Pork brand). The package usually has very large strips that hold their water content for greater lengths of time.  The other brands I've tried are broken into small pieces and are very chewy & dry in comparison.  Another key aspect is the flavoring.  This product is well-flavored whereas other products often taste like proteinated cardboard.  For a teriyaki flavor, Oberto doesn't overdo on salt either and the entire product is natural and less processed.<br /><br />Overview:<br />Pros- Moist, Tastey, Natural & Minimally Processed<br />Cons- Oberto Turkey only comes in Teriyaki<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you want Turkey Jerky and don't mind teriyaki, this is probably the best, easily obtainable product out there."

This stuff was pretty good though. I think the Jack Link's has a better taste due to more flavourings (the secret is in the soy sauce they use, I suspect) where this has a cleaner beef taste which some might like more.<br /><br />I think the beef strips in this brand are a bit too thick, but maybe that's just me."

However, I found the Teriyaki flavor much too sweet. I was hoping for a more subtle Teriyaki taste. To me, the flavor was a little overwhelming. There was no turkey flavor. Just the sweetness of the Teriyaki. I think 7 grams of sugar in a 1-ounce serving (1/3 of a package) seems like a lot. And look at the list of ingredients: Brown sugar is the #2 ingredient, sugar is the #4 ingredient, and pineapple juice concentrate is the #7 ingredient. That's quite a bit of sweetness.

Potassium chloride, the ""salt"" that makes up salt substitutes tastes really, really bad.  Sure.  It's salty.  But it's not salty in the way that sodium chloride is salty.  Adding flavors to it doesn't help (ie garlic salt substitute is just as horrible as regular salt substitute).  Neither does adding lysine.  Nosalt and Also Salt....both terrible.<br /><br />So what do you do if you are like the average person who has severe sodium/potassium imbalance leading to high blood pressure? Get Losalt.  Lord almighty, it's only 1/3 sodium chloride and 2/3 potassium chloride and it tastes almost exactly like real salt.  More importantly, it actually tastes good.  As in you won't cringe putting this stuff on your food.  Who would have thought mixing the potassium chloride with sodium chloride (regular salt) would make it palatable.<br /><br />There is room for improvement.  For example, I'd love it if this stuff came in different ratios.  You get used to 1/3 sodium chloride then, after a few months, lower it to like 10%.  Who knows how much real salt needs to be in there to make it bearable (5%? less).  Also, a healthy dose of magnesium would be nice.  Magnesium deficiency is one of the major players in high blood pressure and pain in the rear to supplement.<br /><br />But let's not get sidetracked here.  The bottom line is, if you are reading this, your probably have high blood pressure and are desperately looking for a salt substitute that won't make you puke.  This is the only one.

I didn't even know they were gone for awhile (due to financial problems I understand).  I am glad Kellogg's bought the company and brought them back.  I recently tried the Vanilla Creme cookie not knowing what to expect.  I was used to the Circus Animals and their delicious chocolate chip cookie over the years since I was a child.  Their Vanilla Creme cookie is just out of this world and makes me glad I have a mouth!  That's how good they are.  It is an exquisite cookie.  No coffee or tea should be served to company without these.  Your friends will wonder what they are and where they come from!<br /><br />In addition to being a great tasting cookie I love the design and texture of the cookie.  I feel really regal when I eat them.  I introduced these to the whole family and I got everyone eating them.  The local supermarket had a sale on them at two dollars a package and I ended up buying seven of them.<br /><br />If you like the taste of vanilla and are looking for a good cookie to try or just plain like cookies, you won't be disappointed with these!<br /><br />UPDATE: I wanted to write a review for Mother's English Tea cookie but apparently Amazon has all the reviews linked to all Mother's cookies products and will only accept one review.<br /><br />I wanted to write that that English Tea cookie by Mother's is just as good as the Vanilla Cremes.  I am not sure but I thought I detected a slight banana flavor but very subtle.  They certainly don't taste like vanilla but they are a really good cookie.<br /><br />Back in the 1970s Mother's Cookies used to put out a variety pack and that's how I discovered their delicious chocolate chip cookie.  It has a chocolate chip taste so different than any other chocolate chip cookie I've eaten.<br /><br />I understand Mother's cookies are hard to find for much of the country except on the west coast.  The fact that Amazon sells them is a good thing.  So if you're wondering if you should give them a try, please believe me, they're all high quality cookies and taste great regardless if they become a favorite or not.  I am very fussy when it comes to food but Mother's cookies are so delicious that I am working my way to try every cookie they offer.  Vanilla Creme is by far my favorite.

This is why I need to watch myself and count the cookies as I eat, to prevent over eating! Though they all taste the same, I am personally more attracted to the pink ones =) So glad I can get these cookies at Wal-mart!<br />I do not recommend buying this online, just because when it gets hot, the cookies tend to stick together. It is annoying having a double-cookie because they will not separate without breaking. Also, always store in a cookie place! Enjoy your cookies =) Thanks for reading!"

However, this nirvana of the cookie munching experience, comes at a pretty hefty price. As I was gleefully polishing off the first bag, I happened to glance at the nutritional stats on the back. To my astonishment and horror, I found that just two cookies delivered 2.5 grams of saturated fat, 2 grams of trans fat, and a whopping 180 calories! For this reason, I removed one rating star and won't be purchasing these again, until this problem is resolved. C'mon Kelloggs, get yer 'stuff' in one bag and cut the trans fat! Sure, the saturated fat content is rather high, but the trans fat is not only unacceptable, it is entirely unnecessary. These cookies could easily be baked with lighter oils like canola, sunflower, or safflower. If you truly must, buy these cookies at your own risk, or better still, fear for your poor arteries and beg-off! [English Tea - 5, Peanut Butter Gauchos - 5, Iced Lemonade - 4, Iced Oatmeal - 3]"

I don't know why they aren't sold nationwide or worldwide at local stores.

Nutty and full flavored, it resembles very little what consumers have come to expect of rice.  It's actually much better.  I would rate Amazon a zero for offering such a fine product and then failing to continue to provide it when it is still readily available from the producer.  For a truly reliable source for this wonderful product, visit the Lundberg Farms website.  Their products can also be found in many grocery stores around the country, not just ""health food"" stores.<br /><br />Update to original review:  The reviewer who reported a darkening of the cooking water was not reporting a fluke.  This rice is not dyed, but requires washing in cold water several times before cooking to make sure that all residue on the outside of the rice is removed.  This is not actually a problem.  Just something that should be done as a matter of good practice in cooking all brown rices.  Dark rices give you more visible evidence of the residue, but it is inherent with the lighter colored brown rices as well.  The lighter colored rices produce a kind of milky solution when first washed which clears with repeated washings.<br /><br />After rinsing a few times, the black rice will retain its original color and the wash water should be relatively clear.  Use your hands to rub the rice together when rinsing to do a thorough job.  Removing this residue helps the individual rice kernels to cook without sticking together.<br /><br />Another tip is to coat the washed rice after the final washing with enough olive oil to produce a light sheen on the rice before cooking it.  This also helps the rice to cook without sticking together and adds the flavor of the olive oil to the rice.  Choice of olive oil should complement the underlying flavor of the rice being cooked and the dish being prepared."

Dentyne's new gum, Pure, is simple. It's a rectangular piece of gum with a hard outer shell and surprising burst of mint extract in the center (think ""mint in mint""). It really freshens your breath! I was actually very surprised when I first bit into it, thinking it was just another piece of gum. Dentyne really did a good job in implementing the flavored center idea and using mint instead of some funky new flavor that lasts for only 5-10 minutes. In my opinion, the flavor actually lasts longer (up to half an hour to an hour) if you bite into it right away, allowing the center's mint extract to envelop your mouth. Give it a try!

We've always eaten the rolled oats and wondered how steel cut oats could be so much better.  Well, they do take a little longer to cook, but no worse than cooking brown rice, and just as easy.  Since our mornings require a quick breakfast I cook a batch (four cups of water, one cup of oats)in the evening and store it in a covered container in the fridge, the next morning we scoop out a serving, heat in the microwave for a minute stir in sugar and cinnamon then add milk.  This makes four hefty servings.  Now eating it requires some time.  You don't just swallow this stuff like the regular rolled oats you may already be accustomed to.  They have a great slightly chewy quality and a great nutty taste that rolled oats just don't seem to have.  McCann's steel cut oats are to be savored.  Don't microwave it long, just enough to warm it.  I'll reserve the old rolled oats for oatmeal cookies, but McCann's is for breakfast from now on at our house.

I was first introduced to John McCann's Oatmeal when I decided to quit eating rolled oats because of their texture and the inspiration of watching the episode of ""GOOD EATS"" featuring steel cut or pinhead or Irish oats. I originally found these oats at my local market and found them to be delicious, although, they do take awhile to properly cook they are by far the best option in terms of flavor, nutrition and texture. Their flavor is similar to brown rice while still having a bit of a ""wheaty"" taste. They are very nutritious, but as most nutritious foods are, they must be portioned because of their high calorie content, (I find that half a cup, 300 calories, is the perfect amount) although they are very good for fighting cholesterol and the fat they contain is ""good"" fat. Their texture is also similar to brown rice, but softer and creamier if prepared in such a fashion. I make my oats two ways, on the weekdays I make them in a rice cooker overnight which produces a piping hot bowl of deliciousness and on the weekends I take my time and prepare them on the stove top. They really are a delicious way to start my day and I look forward to enjoying a bowl every morning. Being that I eat pinhead oats everyday I found that buying these tins was beginning to get quite expensive, so one day I went to a bulk foods market and bought a pound of bulk steel cut oats thinking they would be a lower quality and good for the weekdays. Since then I have done numerous side-by-side comparisons of the two and they are exactly the same in taste and texture, making paying double for John McCann's Oats a delicious, but obsolete choice nonetheless.<br /><br />Pros: Delicious, nutritious, and the tin is re usable.<br />Cons: Somewhat expensive when compared to bulk options.<br />Overall: Buy these if you aren't going to be eating them everyday; they are delicious and well worth the money.<br /><br />I cook my steel cut oats on the stove top thusly:<br />1/2 cup steel cut oats<br />1 tbsp unsalted butter<br />2 cup water (boiling)<br />1/2 cup milk<br />1 pinch of kosher salt<br />2 tsp sweetener (brown sugar, honey, or maple syrup)<br /><br />Take a 12"" sauce pan (or something comparable) with a lid and turn heat to medium, add butter, let melt and add oats. The idea here is to roast the oats. Be sure to shake the pan around every minute or so to keep the oats from burning. After about three to four minutes or until the oats smell toasty add the boiling water and drop the heat to low and cover. Let sit for thirty minutes and slowly stir the oats every five minutes until done. After thirty minutes has elapsed add milk, salt and sweetener stir until combined (If a more creamy mixture is desired add more milk or cream to oats). Serve hot and enjoy."

Now the directions say to make it with four cups water and one cup of the dry oatmeal. But I make it with two cups of water, two cups of milk, and one cup of oatmeal. That adds to the creaminess.<br /><br />Also, here is a wonderful tip I learned from my many times of cooking the oatmeal. This stuff takes about thirty minutes to cook normally (because it has to simmer for a while). What I do is cook it the night before. I boil the milk/water, add the oatmeal, stir it in, put the cover on, then put it in my fridge (without cooking for 30 minutes). In the morning you then take that pot and basically just slowly warm it up to a boil and presto! lovely, creamy steel cut oatmeal for breakfast. BTW, that is enough oatmeal for two people."

I don't like milk so I cook it in fruit juice, sometimes with dried fruit added.  When I cook it in orange juice, I add dried cranberries.  When I cook it in apple juice, I sprinkle cinnamon and just a little nutmeg on it.  I generally cook it in a crock pot set on low for several hours.<br /><br />Regarding the packaging:  Sure the cans get dinged up during shipment.  So what?  The oats don't suffer.

Yes, it was like eating brown rice for breakfast - not that I have anything against brown rice.  This oatmeal does have a little more flavor than regular rolled oats oatmeal.  I also don't have time to cook oatmeal every morning for at least 30 minutes, so I guess you could say that I don't have time for these oats.  If you have the time and like oatmeal to begin with, you may like these.  If you don't like oatmeal and don't have a bunch of time to spend cooking these, then I wouldn't suggest buying them.

As a 4-pack, I think this will probably last me a few months, easily.  Maybe the only pain is that it takes half an hour to make, but it's worth it.  The oats provide a nice bite and a slight crunch, but it's overall smooth.  Honey is always a good thing to add for quick flavor.  Fruits work just as well.  If you're feeling really adventurous, and have a brulee torch on hand, you can sprinkle the top with some sugar and proceed to brulee! And of course, you can add fruit before or after the brulee for a new dimension of flavor!<br />Bottom line, this will fill you up, and for quite a long time."

Later I went online and found it on Amazon marketplace from DAB Nutrition and ordered a pack of four.<br /><br />I never liked rolled oats but once I discovered the steel cut oats I got hooked. I cook mine in my Zojirushi Induction Rice Cooker <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MAIW1C"">Zojirushi NP-HBC18 10-Cup Rice Cooker and Warmer with Induction Heating System, Stainless Steel</a>. I use 4 parts water to I part Oat plus a drop of Extra virgin Olive Oil to avoid sticky residue on the cover. Alternatively I use 2 parts ""Original Rice Dream"" plus 2 parts water to 1 part Oat. Substitute the word ""part"" with the word ""Cup"". I put the mixture in the Rice Cooker and select the Porridge cycle and in 1 hr 7 Mins the cooker would play a beautiful melody to signify that breakfast is ready. You can use the timer setting on the cooker too but it may have a little 'leftover' or 'overcooked' grain taste to it in the morning. This is why I do not like the taste of the so-called ""GABA Brown Rice"". But if you have to leave for work early morning then timer cooking may be a way to go. If you like your oats thick then use 3 parts water to 1 part Oat. Once the Oat is done what you put into it depends on how health conscious you are as well as the limit of your imagination.  Toss in a few dried dates or cherries, how about a spoonful of wheat germ or flax seed? Be creative and your body would thank you for it. I do not cook my oats on stove or in the micro wave. Always buy fresh Oats."

I've tried McCanns and Country Choice, and since there are many reviews already posted,  I'll slant mine based on Taste (mouth), Flavor (nose), Preparation, and Value.<br /><br />I rate Taste (nutty and chewy) and Flavor (pleasant aroma) a dead heat (5*). I also looked at the Nutrition Labels of McCanns, Country Choice, and Quaker's rolled oats, both regular and instant. List included calories, total fats, carbs, fiber, and protein and all were virtually identical from a nutritional standpoint<br /><br />Preparation. I've cooked all types of oatmeal via stove top but have not used the microwave. However, for the steel cut oats I also used a rice cooker, a Zojirushi model that had the capability for making porridge (this is the setting you want to use for steel cut oats),  and this  model had a timer that could be set in advance to finish cooking at a predetermined time. Although use of the rice cooker still requires a passage of time, actual cooking is automatic,  whereas using the stovetop required at least 25-30 minutes of simmering and close supervision to prevent scorching. (Of course, rolled oats takes less time.)<br /><br />Value: McCann's oats comes in a very attractive and elegant metal container (28 oz) and stresses the fact that it's Irish in origin whereas Country Choice comes in a cardboard container(30 oz) similar to the rolled oats type and boasts the fact that it is home grown (Minnesota) and is certified ""organic."" It should be noted that McCann also packages its steel cut oats in a cardboard box (16 oz). If you make your purchase via Amazon (current prices) and disregard the shipping expense, the per ounce cost is: McCann's 28 oz container cost 20.6 cents, McCann's 16 oz container cost 19.13 cents, and Country Choice cost 11.27 cents.<br /><br />Since my personal evaluation finds both products even in Taste and Flavor, and both have similar cooking methodologies, my FIVE STAR choice is for the home grown, organic certified Country Choice which also a big budget saver."

You can eat it plain if you make it thin, or you can add cream, half-and-half, whole milk, or 2% milk to thin it a bit. I also like it with a dollop of plain yogurt. Sweeten it with brown sugar or raw sugar, or just add dried fruit (dates and figs are my favorites - dried cherries are good also). Goes well also with a sprinkle of walnut pieces.

The Irish grown oatmeal is firm and nutty through and through.<br /><br />My electric range cooks the oatmeal in about 25 minutes.  I use a straight-edged spatula to keep the oatmeal from sticking to the bottom of the pan.  Avoid over-stirring to keep that nice, firm texture.<br /><br />More good news: Steel-cut oatmeal, like chili or stew, is better on the second day.  Pour your leftovers into a bowl, lay plastic film directly on the surface of the oatmeal, and store in the 'fridge.  Reheat in the microwave with a spoonful of water for a minute or two.<br /><br />Genuine maple syrup is the best sweetener for oatmeal, in my opinion.

True, it does take 25 minutes and sometimes you need to fool with the water amount and/or the flame until you figure out what to do to get it exactly as you like -- too high a flame, for example, does away with the water before the oatmeal is completely cooked, but remember you don't want it to cook so long that the special consistency is lost. I've cooked it for years but even so when I took a can to our country place where we have a propane gas stove, it was as though I'd never made it before. However, the finished product is  well worth the time. Even unadorned or  with just a bit of grated nutmeg, it has a satisfying crunch and slightly nutty taste. My husband, based on bad childhood oatmeal memories, initially turned up his nose at the thought of eating oatmeal; he likes it so much he makes it for himself several times a week. Two of our younger grandkids accustomed to starting the day with cold commercial cereal ask for the ""special"" oatmeal when they visit. Additionally, it's substantial; a  serving at breakfast easily holds you till lunch time. PLEASE NOTE -- what I've written refers only to McCann's in the tin; I've never tried the flakes."

At any rate, rather than argue the relative virtues of rolled vs. steel cut oat cereals, I sing the praises of both.  Maybe it's a seasonal thing, the somewhat coarser, nuttier, rougher steel cuts somehow more fitting to cold winters than are the mellower and softer rolled oats.  It's like black coffee to an au lait, dark beer to light, hard bebop to cool jazz...you get the picture.<br /><br />You'll also feel virtuous spending some old-fashioned time over the stove (albeit not that much, or that arduous).  The warming experience is itself sufficient, you'll feel like mending a fence somewhere (or tearing it down if in a RObert Frost frame of mind), but it's common to top this<br /><br />with contrasting fruit, or perhaps nuts, syrups, flax seed oil, brown sugar, yoghurt, raisins, prunes, lat night's stew?--it's HEARTY enough to stand up to almost anything you can throw at it.  Your doctor will probably extol the nutritional benefits: Fiber, protein, certain vitamins, etc.  McCann's is the best of the bunch, and yes, that is a can that belongs in the Smithsonian--or its Irish equivalent.

It's made from nothing but 100% whole grain oat kernels which are grown in Ireland and cut in a device similar to a burmill.  The cutting technique provides a much firmer and more complex texture than the rolling which is used on commoditized oatmeal products available in the U.S.  This is not an ""instant"" or ""quick"" oat product, and these oats have not been precooked at all.<br /><br />What this means is that McCann's Traditional makes a great bowl of porridge with a fresh grain flavor and an al dente consistency.  This is oatmeal with a natural crunch and tang to it.  Rolled oats -- especially instant, sugar-added, flavored rolled oats -- don't come close.<br /><br />The obverse of this is that you are actually cooking these grains rather than merely heating and stirring a pre-cooked product.  Be prepared to spend some time -- a half hour or so -- in your kitchen  watching over these and stirring them with your spurtle (porridge-stirring spoon).  Consider this a luxury, an excuse to slow down for a while.  You can find cooking ideas and great recipes at goldenspurtle dot com, which is the home page for the world porridge-making championships.  Specialty porridges, made with fresh fruits, liqueurs, and cream sauces, make distinctive desserts if you really want to get creative.<br /><br />A few more things: these oats are kosher, the can looks sharp, and they make great cookies."

Of my four cans, one was nearly undamaged.  One had cosmetic damage in the form of a dented side.  The other two were dented to the extent of having sharp creases in the bottom and flaws near the seal lines at the top.  I never buy cans like those at the supermarket.<br /><br />COOKING<br /><br />The cooking went much better than I expected.  The evening before, I put 1/4 cup chopped black walnuts, 10 pitted prunes cut into pieces with scissors, and two cups of water into my saucepan.  I brought this mixture to a boil over a simmering-level flame on my propane stove.  I dumped in one-half-cup of McCann's steel cut oats and stirred.  I waited for the mixture to come to a boil again, stirred it a little, turned off the flame, put a lid on the saucepan, and went to bed.  In the morning I was surprised to find that it was perfectly edible with no further cooking.  I did heat it up again on the stove before serving but it stuck to the pot, so I think in the future I will microwave it right in the bowls just before serving it.<br /><br />EATING<br /><br />These oats were good, but it was hard to say if they were ""nuttier"" in flavor than the Old-Fashioned Rolled Oats which I had been eating because I cooked them both with nuts.  The texture was of course firmer.  I do like bulgar wheat and these oats are more like that in texture.  Since I was careful not to overcook the rolled oats, there was not much difference in the ""slime"" feel of the two, but the rolled oats were papery much like eating raw oatmeal cookie dough.<br /><br />NUTRITION<br /><br />I found little difference between the nutritional content listed on the McCann steel cut can and that listed on the Old-Fashioned Rolled Oats container.  I had to do some Internet research to find the differences which turn out to be subtle but important for certain types of health conditions.  There is also the likelihood of the product simply being fresher due to less processing and better packaging at the mill.<br /><br />REPEAT PURCHASE<br /><br />Now that I have found that the cooking of steel cut oats is much less intimidating than I had imagined, I will probably eat these in preferance to rolled oats in the future.  The possibility of adding them to soups and other cooked entrees in place of barley or bulgar wheat is a bonus.  However, I will probably try a more economical source as I am not convinced that Ireland's soil is superior to that in any other region in which oats are farmed, and metal cans with sharp creases and bent seams don't seem worth the extra cost."

The only difference in nutrition data is that the Whole Foods brand is insignificantly higher in calories from fat as well as fiber, protein and iron.

(Cincinnati is a very German city, originally called ""Porkopolis"" for the numerous slaughterhouses and sausage-makers located there.) Goetta is a sort of loaf-type scrapple, utilizing sausage, ground beef and other meats for a base. Some pals of mine often make it up, using organ meat from deer that they harvest.<br /><br />I cannot assert that goetta is a huge favorite of mine but I occasionally imbibe in the sausage-type which is okay. It takes a great deal of time and trouble to make but when it's finished, you cut slices from a loaf of goetta, fry them in a bit of cooking oil or in a great knob of melted butter, and then pour pancake syrup over it, or, if you're a Hillbilly like me, good sorghum molasses. Most generally, I serve it alongside eggs-over-medium or with scrambled eggs. This dish has somehow become a big item in deer hunting camps and I know guys who will eat it three times a day during hunting excursions.<br /><br />Goetta has a long cooking time which is why regular rolled oats won't work in the recipe.

They are more pellet like bits instead of flattened oatmeal, and it seems to have a little bit more of a nutty flavor.  (More like buckwheat)  It's important that you know it will take longer to cook than your standard oatmeal so if you're looking for a quick breakfast you'll have to cook it up the night before.  I just boil water in a pot and then add in the oatmeal. (As the directions state) It will take about 30 minutes to make with some stirring.  Once it's done cooking I'll add a splash of milk, and brown sugar and it's delicious.  The texture is definitely more firm than the ""standard"" oatmeal.<br /><br />I took one star off since all of the cans in the 4 pack I bought were dented, two of them pretty badly and they don't easily close.  There is a seal on the inside so this doesn't affect the oatmeal you'll just need to put it in a different container if you want it to stay fresh.<br /><br />Yum!"

I've tried some of the short cuts but I find it best to cook it for 30 - 35 minutes rather than any pre-cook or microwave method.  I use a small rice cooker I bought at Target. It's electric with a 4 cup pan, steamer stage that sits on top of the pan and a glass lid.  I put a spoon through each handle to weight down the steamer stage, otherwise, the boiling oatmeal will push it off the pan. I've also learned to not use the glass lid to keep it from boiling over.  When I get up I start it and it turns off when it's done.  In the meantime I get ready for the day. Best with a real nutty whole grain bread and coffee.  I've tried several other brands and nothing compares.  Amazon's price is cheaper than Walmart."

I did the research and was amazed at all I found about the health benefits of steel cut oats. I was greatly encouraged by the rave reviews on Amazon, but I admit, a bit skeptical. I mean, really, it's JUST oatmeal, right?<br /><br />Wrong! I bought this product and the quick-cooking variety as well. I am hooked on this product!  I am usually NOT one to plan ahead, but I make a big batch of this at the beginning of the week, portion it out into covered bowls and have it for breakfast everyday. I love the chewy texture and nutty flavor. I've made it with water, milk and organic apple juice. My favorite is half water, half apple juice with pecans, dried cranberries and cinnamon. SO delicious and filling! However one of the things I love about buying this ""basic"" product is being able to mix it up however I like.<br /><br />Yes, the cans arrived dented, but the oatmeal was intact, so it didn't bother me a bit. I did find the same product at my local Publix for $4.99 a can, which is  cheaper than the Amazon price, however, since I have Prime the shipping is free AND I will probably subscribe to the auto ship on this product, which does lower the price to less than my local store, plus, NO TAX (and Tennessee DOES love their taxes on food items). But if Amazon offers another amazing deal on it, I won't hesitate to stock up (and get ONLY the long cooking version this time)!<br /><br />I definitely recommend this product and will be pestering my mom and sisters to get some too.

Amazon is a great deal, and you get free shipping.<br /><br />FYI, medium- to long-term is it unhealthy to consume steel-cut oatmeal UNLESS you soak it in warm water with something acidic between 12 to 24 hours, preferably some fermented milk product like yogurt, kefir, buttermilk, etc.  Reason being is that oatmeal contains in its hull enzyme inhibitors that have a chelating effect on your body, i.e., they remove metal from your body.  While short-term this may be beneficial (meat eaters stockpile extra iron, copper, etc. over time), medium-term this could lead to deficiencies in essential metals.  Soaking the oatmeal at least overnight neutralizes the enzyme inhibitors.  Additionally, it allows you to cook up the oatmeal in about five minutes, versus over 30 minutes when left unsoaked.<br /><br />This recipe follows the recipe in Nourishing Traditions, but basically soak one part oatmeal with one part lukewarm water.  Add a little bit of yogurt to create the acidic environment: I use one TBSP per 1/2 cup of oatmeal and 1/2 cup of warm water.<br /><br />Oatmeal should be eaten with some fat (many of the vitamins are fat soluble), so I add butter or cream.  I also add shredded flax and coconut, increasing the healthiness of my breakfast.  I then top it off with plenty of raw honey (also from Amazon), which sweetens my porridge and thus makes me look forward to breakfast in the morning.<br /><br />Enjoy!"

These steel cut oats have a toasty, nutty, wonderful flavor that is distinct from steel cut oats grown elsewhere. The tin is of course wonderful; it keeps this slightly oily grain fresh and it can be used when empty for holding coins, treasures buried in the backyard or any other number of things.<br /><br />The oats take longer to cook than standard rolled oatmeal, but that's not a problem if you soak the oats, use a pressure cooker, rice cooker or plan ahead. We love these oats in winter with a dab of butter and a teaspoon or two of local wildflower honey. Good with salt and cream also."

It does take 30 minutes to cook, but following the directions on the can (4 cups water, 1 cup oats) this makes four breakfasts (just under 1 cup of cooked oats each) for me; it might make 5 for smaller appetites.<br /><br />I make it in the evening by starting with the water and oats, with just a touch of salt in the water. Stir the oats initially, then set a timer and leave it be on very low heat (just barely bubbling). At the end of 30 minutes, stir well, then I divide the oatmeal into 4 equal parts (usually just under 1 cup each) and put it into those little Glad Serv-n-Saver type containers (the ""Tupperware"" you don't mind losing!). Into each container (""bowl"") I like to mix a handful of raisins (or other dried fruit, but raisins are my personal favorite), a dash or two of cinnamon, about a tablespoon of honey and a tablespoon of ground flax seed. I then mix each thoroughly and cover; then all 4 ""ready to heat and serve"" bowls go into the fridge.<br /><br />Each morning, then, I pour about a tablespoon of skim or soy milk on top of the oatmeal, then microwave for 1min 20sec (your oven may vary, of course). Stir, and enjoy; I eat it right out of the Serv-n-Saver bowl, which cuts down on washing, too! It's a wonderful tasting, quick and HEALTHY part of your breakfast. It's high fiber, so it's filling, which tends to cut your overall caloric intake and it goes a long way toward the American Heart Association's recommended daily fiber serving; most Americans are woefully below this in their usual diet.<br /><br />I highly recommend this as a part of a healthy, low-fat, low calorie, low glycemic and high fiber diet. It helped me drop my total cholesterol level over 40 points (as part of a comprehensive diet plan) WITHOUT drugs."

After experimenting a bit, and reading lots of recipes, I've come up with a simple, yet tasty way to prepare McCANN's Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal. Give it a try, and you may decide that oatmeal can be a healthy and delicious addition to your breakfast menu.<br /><br />Recipe:<br /><br />- Start by bringing 3 cups of water to a boil (about 3-4 minutes in the microwave).<br />- In a medium saucepot, melt 1 tablespoon of butter then add 1 cup of oats. Toast the oats on medium heat for about 3 minutes.<br />- Add the boiling water to the toasted oats and simmer for 25 minutes. Don't stir. It should get to a soft bubbling simmer.<br />If it boils to hard, you stove is set too hot, so turn it down or it will burn.<br />- Add 1 cup of milk (or can do with a mix of milk and buttermilk).<br />- Cook an additional 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.<br /><br />Makes 4-5 good size servings with excellent texture and consistency. It thickens once it sits a little bit. You can increase or decrease the milk to adjust the consistency as desired. You can also save it for up to a week in the refrigerator without much difference in taste. Just store in small sealed bowls. Each can of McCANNs oatmeal makes about 16-20 servings.<br /><br />Everyone likes to top and sweeten their oatmeal differently (sugar, brown sugar, maple syrup, raisins, etc.). Only add the toppings when you're ready to eat it, not before storing in the refrigerator. For my serving, I like to add 2 tsp of brown sugar, 2 tsp of maple syrup, a sprinkle of cinnamon, about 1/2 tbsp of butter, and then top with chopped pecans. I know it's not particularly healthy, but it is very tasty. Hope you enjoy!<br /><br />Please be kind enough to indicate if reviews are helpful."

Storing 4 cans was not an issue, considering each 28 ounce can is about as big as a quart of paint.

Let me explain why:<br /><br />Intro to Oats 101--Oats, in whole form, are known as groats. In an effort to cut down on cooking time (or eating time, for those on the run, who don't have the time or patience to chew @mouthful 20-30x), oats are refined into the following:<br /><br />  -steel cut oats--cracked into two or more pieces<br />  -oat flakes--flattened with an oat roller<br />  -oatmeal--same as flakes, but parboiled<br />  -instant oatmeal--more processed than reg. oatmeal<br />  -oat flour--milled into dust, for baked goods or as a thickening<br />  agent.<br /><br />This product fits into the first catagory.  Their claim of ""guaranteed uniformity"" is a coined phrase, meaning each cracked grain is the same size, a gourmet characteristic.<br /><br />All this being said, I am not aware of oats from Scotland or Ireland having any magical or mystical quality, outside of marketing hype or myth.  Truth be told, you could go to any health food store with a bulk bin (one sign of a conscientious health food store), buy whole oats, certified organic, for about $2 per lb., and crack your own oats with a grain mill (Corona brand, one time investment, about $70, lifetime expectancy), or in a blender. For those more ambitious, you could cook them whole, which involves soaking them overnight, then simmering for about 90 minutes. Do not be put off by the cooking time, it is unattended, with a flame deflector. Cooking becomes a chore because of prep time, not the time on the stove.<br />Why whole? Because any time you grind or crack a grain, there is nutrient loss and, to those open to more estoteric models, a loss of life force (a.k.a. ""chi"").<br /><br />I did buy this product, and as connoisseur of oats, I was not impressed, did not give the same energy boost as others. Did not taste fresh, either.<br /><br />Now, onto an advanced concept: if you truly want the ""Rolls Royce"" of oats, there is a brand called ""Really Raw Oats"". Why is this? Because the oats commercially available are partially steamed to protect against rancidity (oats are about 10% fat, albeit an exceptionally healthful fat).  How do I know this? Because a truly raw grain will sprout. Attempts to sprout other oats have been fruitless.<br /><br />The Really Raw Oats carry a price tag of about $11 per lb., but are worth it. Conversely, the product here, in my opinion, does not command the price point it seeks.<br /><br />p.s.  the best TASTING oats I had came out of Canada--when you dry-roasted them in a pan, it took on the aroma of vanilla--BLISS! Haven't seen them, however, since the mid 1990's.

Most people are used to instant oatmeal which you just add hot water to.  Neither slow cook or steel cut are like that.  So, if you don't like taking the extra time to cook your oatmeal don't get steel cut.<br /><br />The oatmeal has a geat flavor, and is very filling.  It may have a completely different texture from any oatmeal you'ver ever eaten.  Several people have stated that it has a nutty texture and nutty flavor, they're correct.  Our whole family loves the taste.<br /><br />My only complaint isn't with the oatmeal, but with Amazon's packaging.  Several other buyers complained about this, so I was aware of it.  They put the oatmeal in a box bigger than it needed to be and then didn't pack the oatmeal firmly.  So, the cans moved around and knocked into each other during shipment.  We ordered 2 (pack of 4) sets, and they were shipped separately, although they arrived one day apart.  Of the 8 cans we received only 4 made it without blemish.

After some research I came across the John McCann brand at Amazon which turned out to be a stroke of luck. It is truly delicious and I'm delighted that I signed up for a regular supply.<br />After cooking the recommended way for a few days I tried the suggestion made by another reviewer of boiling the four cups of water (I use two cups of water and two of low-fat milk - wonderful!) the night before, stirring the cup of oats in, putting a lid on and placing it in the refrigerator to 'cook' overnight. IT WORKS (thanks Amazon for reviews!) - though I prefer to leave it sitting out for an hour or so to cook in its own heat and then place it in the fridge before going to bed. Next morning all you have to do is heat on the stove or in the microwave (takes seconds!)and you've got a delicious, healthful breakfast with minimal effort."

About once a week or so in the evening when I'm in the kitchen cooking something else anyway, I partially cook up a pot of oats (I've always used McCanns, which is great, and I'm going to try some from the local health food store out of the bin -- I'll then decide whether to switch.)<br /><br />Anyway, 4 cups of water brought to a boil, 1 cup of oats added and simmered until the oats are just starting to get a little chewy, then turn off the heat and let it sit to cool.  Some extra cooking and softening will take place while it is cooling, but you want to leave them pretty chewy.  Then, into a sealed plasticware container in the fridge.  The amount of tending that is needed is minimal during this process -- just occasional stirring to keep it from sticking until the heat is turned off.<br /><br />Each morning, I scoop out what I want (for me, 2/3 of a cup), add a little water, stir it up, and microwave for just under a minute and a half.  Sprinkle on some cinnamon and freshly cut up fruit and raw slivered nuts. and you have about as healthy a breakfast item as you could want --  no more than a 2-3 minutes of morning prep time.  High fiber, complex carbs, no gluten, low calorie, and it stays with you all morning.<br /><br />Once you get into this routine, you'll wonder why you ever touched instant or quick oatmeal, or any rolled oats for that matter.  You'll learn to adjust how long you want the initial cook to be, how much water to add before microwaving, and how long to microwave depending on how soft you want the final bowl of oats to be, depending on your personal taste.  I feel more satisfied with a chewy oatmeal and think it tastes better a little undercooked, but to each his own.<br /><br />Only downside preventing 5 stars?  McCann's is a bit expensive compared to bulk steel-cut oats that is available to many, but a can goes a long ways, and is certainly cheap compared to most unhealthy ""quick"" breakfast foods.  Compare for yourself with what is in the bins at your local organic stores and decide for yourself if the extra price is worth it, but if you haven't eaten steel cut oats yet you owe it to yourself to try it.  Also, I've lived places where McCann's was the only steel-cut oats that could be found at the local grocer, so in a choice between McCanns and a cereal other than steel cut oats,  -- spend the money.<br /><br />This is basically the only grain I eat.  Another caveat -- I've never bought it through Amazon, but I would imagine that the quality is going to be very uniform for this product regardless of source."

My memories of it were not terribly fond though, as it was always soupy and weak. We always had to dump on the brown sugar or maple syrup to give it any flavor whatsoever.<br /><br />I continued to buy instant oatmeal through college and into adulthood, but would always use far less water than called for on the package, mainly just to give it some texture. I thought that was the best oatmeal could get.<br /><br />Then one day someone made me a bowl of steel cut oatmeal, and it was seriously like Oatmeal reinvented! For one it looks nothing like rolled oats--instead of flat little flakes these are like little pellets. When cooked, steel cut oatmeal gets an awesome ""al dente"" consistency that is both smooth and chewy. But more importantly, steel cut oatmeal has a wonderful rich flavor I've never tasted in rolled oats. I find that with this I only add a very minimal amount of sweetener (usually maple syrup but honey also works). Sometimes I add some cranberries or fresh blueberries if I have them, but it is perfectly delicious sans extras.<br /><br />Yes, it takes preparation, but it's the best use of my rice cooker I've found (ironically I use it more for oatmeal than I do for rice!). I just pour in the oatmeal and water the night before, set the cooker to porridge mode and set the timer for whatever time I want to eat. In the morning, I wake up to the wonderful smell of the cooking oats and by the time I'm dressed and ready for breakfast, they're all ready to go.<br /><br />I can't recommend these highly enough.

Stand by the pot and keep stirring so it doesn't overflow the pot or stick to the bottom.  I love the flavor and the sort of crunch.  It would also be good with dried cranberries and some walnuts or slivered almonds.  It's a few pennies cheaper at Trader Joe but they don't always have it.  I've been eating it every day and thoroughly love it.<br /><br />EDITED TO GIVE A GREAT AND EASY WAY TO COOK STEEL-CUT OATS:<br />After a few batches, I have perfected this stovetop technique for steel-cut oats:<br />1. boil 4 cups of water in a pot on the stove<br />  (optional:  1/2 cup non-fat dry milk to up the calcium)<br />2. add 1 1/2 cups of steel-cut oats<br />3. bring to rolling boil again<br />4. cover tightly and let it keep boiling for a few seconds<br />5. turn off flame and forget about it.<br /><br />It doesn't take too long, under 1/2 hour I think but not sure, and the water is totally absorbed and you have the perfect combination of creamy/chewy steel-cut oats.<br /><br />You get enough for quite a few servings; not sure how many. 10 maybe??<br /><br />Nothing stuck to the bottom of the pot.

It's silly, but the esthetics of food do play a big role in how much we enjoy it.<br /><br />Still, packaging wouldn't mean anything if the taste wasn't there.  Happily, these oats have more texture and flavor than any others I have eaten.  Will the taste blow you away?  Well, truthfully, no.  You could argue that ""tastiest oatmeal"" is kind of like being ""tallest dwarf"" or ""smartest stooge"".  This is also not a product to consider if you are feeding three teenagers on a budget.

There is nothing especially magical about the McCann version of this---you can get steel cut oats in bulk in practically any store that sells organic cereals and grains---but this brand remains my nostalgic favorite since I was introduced to these in childhood. Cooks beautifully in about 20 minutes without stirring or intervention of any kind if you use a double boiler.  Or better yet, load it into a programmable rice cooker the night before. The nutty, chewy texture is essential to the experience, and in that regard, the double boiler approach delivers a somewhat crunchier end result than my rice cooker, which creates a softer, more porridge-like oatmeal, due to the longer presoak and cooking time involved with the night-before approach.<br /><br />The cans keep quite a long time unopened---at least a year or two if the freshness dates are to be believed--- but I find the grains start to taste a littel stale or musty if you keep an open can more than a month or two."

It can take about 35 minutes to cook them from start to finish, with lots of stirring of the pot and keeping track of exactly how the heat is regulated on your stove.  I have made them the ""long"" way many times.  The taste is absolutely wonderful and the texture is quite pleasing.  I have also soaked the oats in water overnight and then cooked them the next morning which reduces the cooking time to about 10 minutes for me.  Still the same wonderful taste, but this method loses quite a lot of the whole grain sensation in the mouth.<br /><br />I was in the market for a rice cooker and while investigating them I noticed that some have a setting for porridge.  When I made my choice of the Panasonic SR-DE103 rice cooker it was partially because I wanted to use it to cook these oats.  The only drawback is that the rice cooker will only cook two servings at a time because the oats foam and bubble up so much during cooking.  Any more than two servings and they will be bubbling out of the steam vent of the cooker!  It also takes one hour to cook those two servings, but I can be off doing other things while the cooker takes care of the oats.  The oats cooked in the rice cooker have the same taste and texture as those cooked for the 35 minute method on the stove.<br /><br />This product is delightful.  I do add a tiny pinch of salt during the cooking time.  They are wonderful with either white sugar, brown sugar, honey, maple syrup, butter, or just completely unadorned.  And, which is very important, a serving of these steel cut oats stick with me and I don't find myself wanting to eat a second breakfast two hours later.  One serving lasts until lunch time and beyond (if I'm really busy).  Any leftovers also keep well in a bowl in the refrigerator and warm up nicely in the microwave.

But you have to use a bit less water too - use about 3x water instead of 4x.<br /><br />I really like the extra texture that this short cooking provides.  If you find it a bit hard at first, leave it stading for a couple of minutes and it will soften more.

I absolutely love that I've got an option of having it hot or cold. I do have trouble getting it fully blended when it's cold.

For 3 Points Plus a serving, this is a great snack/recovery drink/indulgence.  I have not tried the drink hot and I don't plan on it.  The only drawback I found was when I made the drink with just water (following the directions) I did get a ton of clumps.  I shook the container for about 25 seconds, too.

I think it's the extra espresso flavor that really kicks it up.  So many of the protein drinks are bland, it's nice to have a little flavor.  One drawback is the price... each drink takes 2 scoops.

Remove lid, replace straw, ENJOY!<br /><br />In my opinion, drinking this shake this way is REALLY delicious and taste just like iced coffee. It does NOT have the typical protein shake flavor and aftertaste at all.  I just wish they made a decaffeinated version so I could drink it all day long!<br /><br />Unfortunately, I didn't really enjoy this shake hot, but I'm going to continue experimenting with that and update my review accordingly!"

I first must admit I'm a 20-something guy who has tried a number of protein products in my day, some good, most bad to terrible. My personal favorite is muscle milk light due to its flavor and ease of mixing. After trying Click, I can't imagine a better protein drink early in the morning. The flavor is excellent (I prefer Vanilla Latte over Mocha personally) and it mixes with ease. Great in water or milk. Recently I've been blending it in the morning with Almond Milk and a few ice cubes and it's awesome. I usually don't like Vanilla Latte drinks at Starbucks because the vanilla is overpowering but not with this mix.  It's really not even accurate to call it ""Vanilla Latte"". I think its just an improved Mocha flavor, which is what I'd prefer. 15 grams of protein in the morning helps curb your appetite and its also low in sugar in fat which is usually a problem with protein drinks.  Biggest problem I can find is that Click is clearly being marketed towards women given the bright pink/purple canister and female stick figure on the label.  Honestly, this is a product that both health conscience men and women should be happy to use in the morning. Right now I don't know another company that is offering a product like this (Muscle Milk has a coffee flavor but it's not as good) and given how important breakfast is to a healthy diet and a weight loss plan, Click is a great addition to your pantry. The price is fair, especially since you'll get a discount through Amazon.  If your interested in losing weight, give Click a try. It's less than you'll pay for a week of bagels and coffee at Starbucks and a whole lot healthier for you."

I have only tried the vanilla flavor and it has been wonderful.  The idea behind me taking this protein drink is actually two-fold.  The first is to not eliminate but lower my coffee drinking addiciton (i.e. starbucks use ot be a morning ritual!) and also because it has some calories but not too many, I've been using it as a meal replacement for breakfast time.  I'm trying to lose weight, and this is helping me get closer to my goal weight.<br /><br />Since each serving is only 100 calories, you should be prepared for that you will feel hungry about an hour after you drink it.  I started taking Yohimbine Powder, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005XOUOA4"">5 Grams Yohimbine HCL 99% Bulk Powder</a> shortly after starting to drink these shakes, and if you are trying to cut back on calories, I highly recommend some kind of natural appetite suppressant, you have no idea the difference it makes, basically a life-saver for me as I'm what you would call a snacker of snacks!<br /><br />I know some other reviewers have said that stiring the mix works for them but I'm sorry if you really want to enjoy this shake, you need a blender, plain and simple.

This mix really has a smooth mocha flavor.<br /><br />I've been drinking it hot in my morning cappuccino - I whisk one or two scoop into some hot water to mix, then a shot of espresso and then top it off with steamed unsweetened soy milk, and it makes an AMAZING morning cup.<br /><br />I've already thrown it into protein shake concoctions in the blender, and it's OMG!? DELICIOUS with blended ice and additional flavors.  (THINK ABOUT THE OPTIONS HERE PEOPLE!)<br /><br />The nutrition:<br /><br />  * 2 scoops contain:<br />  * 120 calories<br />  * 1.5 grams of fat<br />  * 115 mg sodium<br />  * 290 mg potassium<br />  * 12 carbohydrate<br />  * 1 fiber<br />  * 7 sugar (fructose)<br />  * 15 protein<br /><br />Overall, I am very impressed with Click Protein.  There is NO telltale protein-y taste, you that icky tongue-feel and after taste you might get with other protein products?  I don't know how it's possible, but it's true - you cannot tell that this is a protein drink by any stretch.<br /><br />Add that to the fact that it contains my two main food groups, espresso and chocolate?  It's a clear winner, and my new thing.<br /><br />[...]"
565540,B002GKEK7G,A1D2N40NZ7LHM9,"J. J. Hagglund ""Amazon User Extraordinaires""",54,74,5,1257465600,Wow. WOW! So Good!,"This is, so far, my very favorite protein shake.<br /><br />If you love coffee then you should follow the directions- the mocha flavor is nice and strong in 12 oz of fluid (I do milk, to up the protein content; more on that later).  If you like coffee with chocolate flavor then this is the mix for you!<br /><br />Personally, I like putting 16 oz of milk in a Blender Bottle (with the genius blender ball) and then two scoops of Click powder.  I personally love mocha when the chocolate is predominant with a hint of coffee, and this tastes like chocolate milk with a delicious coffee undertone.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the protein content is a little bit low (15g per serving) and it's $1.50 a serving.  Honestly, it's so good that the money is worth it.  It's also way less spendy- at least half the cost of your average drink- than getting a mocha at a coffee stand and far healthier.  As far as the protein goes, if I do the 16 oz of milk then I get 33 grams of protein in a shake.  Not too bad, and again, it tastes so great!<br /><br />As an RNY gastric bypass patient I find it difficult to in 80 grams of protein from shakes per day, particularly because most things just don't taste that great.  This is the first protein drink I've had that is genuinely good, not just, ""Meh, I guess that's ok for a protein drink.""  I fully recommend this to anyone!!<br /><br />Lastly, you can search around for other recipes- some people add a scoop of vanilla protein powder and a splash of drip coffee, or drip coffee and sugar free vanilla syrup, etc.  I also hear Click makes DELICIOUS protein ice cream, and I plan to give that a go in the upcoming weeks.  If it is delicious I'll leave this as is.  If it's nasty (which, based on how great this stuff tastes, then I doubt it will be!) I'll edit my review to reflect that.<br /><br />Enjoy!"

I finally decided that a coffee flavor was the only one I could enjoy.  I used Whey Gourmet Artic Cappuccino Frappe but had to add ice, vanilla almond milk, extra instant coffee, and even a splash of creamer to get the desired ""fresh from starbucks"" flavor.  That's a lot of additional cost and calories.  I decided to give Click a try and purchased both the Mocha and the Vanilla Latte.  I'm hooked on the Vanilla Latte.  The Mocha was too sweet and heavy feeling for me, but my husband loved it.<br /><br />I use a Magic Bullet...load the cup with ice and WATER (yes, just water) to 1 inch from top, add my two scoops of Click, and blend.  If it's a special day, a dash of caramel sugar free syrup or spritz of whipped cream.  Seriously, everyone thinks I've got Starbucks.  It keeps me full until lunch!  If I'm feeling especially snackish in the evening, I'll have another to feel full until bedtime.  Seriously, sweet and satisfying for this few calories????  It can't be beat!!!"

It's got some nice nutritionals.

Usually the first thing in the a.m. on my list is to brew a pot of coffee and mix a soy protein shake from GNC. But not here lately.

I used to get a stomach ache daily that I just sort of got used to - was it too much coffee on an empty stomach or the soy in the protein shake from GNC?? Who knows.<br />What I do know is that today, for example, I drank two Click shakes back to back with my supplements I take every a.m. (Omega 3, multi, Acai, B complex...) and I feel great. No stomach ache, no jitters, energetic and content.<br />I would highly recommend this product. I've just ordered two more canisters! Enjoy!"

Milk is already an ingredient, so just add water if you're watching carbs.  Also try one scoop Click and one scoop of your regular vanilla protein mix in the drink or frappuccino if you want a lighter taste and less carbs.<br /><br />I've used it in the morning when I don't have time to brew coffee (or eat) and have to run out the door. It's actually a good post- exercise recovery with the carbs and protein if you want to switch your mixes up.  Plus to me it's kind of like a guiltless pleasure for those days you just don't feel like downing a protein drink.<br /><br />At my house a McDonald's Frappe/Starbucks Frappuccino drinker and the kids both love it!"

Now when it comes to getting protein in, that has been a challenge.  Most protein powders have a terrible taste and smell to them making it less than desireable to drink.  With Click Mocha, I add it to a cup of milk, half cup of water, ice cubes into a blender shaker bottle with a scoop of protein powder (such as EAS or Syntrax Chocolate or vanilla) and one Click scoop of Click - two scoops is a serving.  Shake it up and go, this is my morning routine every single morning. And I do mean every single morning.  I am NOT a breakfast eater, so this helps me get some protein in and lasts me until I'm either ready to eat breakfast or lunch depending on the time.<br /><br />The coffee flavor is not strong in the mocha,  so I do add some instant decaf espresso ( I try to limit my caffine daily, if your not limiting your caffine then add leaded instant espresso) Bustello is my decaf instant espresso of choice and is more economical than Starbucks Decaf Via (Got a box of this for my birthday so I have tried using half a serving and still get AWESOME coffee flavor)<br /><br />If I just want a little afternoon pick up, I will use cold brewed coffee and add some milk and a half a scoop of click to make my iced coffee creamier.

This one was spit out.  I read all the reviews and gave it a try, but I find there is a nasty and bitter taste to it that lingers long after it is gone - much like the taste of artificial sweeteners for me.  I realize that it may just be me - I also can not tolerate the taste of any diet drink for the same reason, so take this review for what it is - my opinion.<br /><br />I also, however, found it very difficult to mix, and found it had a waxy consistency which I found very unpleasant. I did give it several tries - cold, luke warm, hot. Used a blender, a shaker cup, an immersion blender - all with the same taste and consistency results.

But I am SO GLAD I received the item.<br /><br />The Taste:<br />Imagine a Starbuck's Frappachino with added vitamins.  Yes, there's that vitamin taste, but that's the nature of shakes like this.<br /><br />The Caffeine:<br />I usually eat this with my lunch to give me the added boost I need to make it to my 530pm class and back home.  I tried having it for dinner one night.  Bad idea.  I was up until 3am.  Yes, there's plenty of caffeine in there but I won't drink it after 1pm.<br /><br />The fill-up factor:<br />Fiber is the best filler.  Protein is great with those who have to watch their glycemic level.  I developed gestational diabetes when I was pregnant with my twins and was borderline diabetic at one point.  I NEED protein in high amounts to keep my blood glucose levels at an even keel.  This works.  It staves hunger and has the fiber and protein to help me forget about being hungry for an hour or two.<br /><br />I would recommend this to those who are looking for a way to stave hunger or get caffeine with added vitamins and/or protein.<br /><br />I would also suggest getting a mixer bottle with the wire wisk ball.

But if I'm going to write a review about anything...CLICK is it. If you like coffee, strong coffee like Starbuck Coffee, you'll LOVE CLICK Mocha Double Cappuccino. It's strong, but without the choking bitterness of too strong coffee. CLICK makes a perfect morning wake up, and I've been a ""gotta have a pot of coffee to wake-up"" person for many years. CLICK is great! Two scoops, stir it around in your cup...zap it in the micro for 1 minute, stir again...another 30 seconds, and all done...simply perfect eye opener. I drink this first, while my pot of coffee is brewing, and within 15 minutes I'm human again. No guilt either, because this has 15 grams of protein and all your vitamins and good stuff to get you going. It's like one of those trendy 1 oz. power shots, but only better because it's also a meal replacement.<br />After buying two canisters at my physician's office for 24.00 apiece, 16.00 per canister (plus free shipping) when you buy from Amazon scheduled shipping, is quite a deal. That averages less than 1.25 per serving, far less expensive than a Starbucks daily, or even a local fast food coffee.

I frankly can't begin to understand the complaints here about it being hard to prepare. I add two scoops to about a third of a cup cold, nonfat milk, stir it smooth (just using a spoon, with no problem), fill the rest of the mug with water and nuke it until it's drinking-range hot.<br />Note: Do not heat it to near boiling and then sit it by you to slowly cool as you sip, like you might with a real coffee drink. Too much heat curdles protein, powders, and *yuck!* (I think this is what's been happening to those who complain of its lumpiness, or ""boogery"" texture.)

I put only one scoop (instead of the recommended two scoops) in a glass of water, and it is still too sweet. But this comes from me who usually drink black coffee, so may be just my personal preference.<br /><br />The fact that this drink uses primarily fructose instead of glucose doesn't help either. The recent studies show that fructose is ""more bad"" than glucose due to heart disease and diabetes concerns. (I provided a scientific link here, but it was edited out by Amazon. But you can search on the Internet.)<br /><br />Primarily because of the sweetness, this drink is enjoyable at the beginning, but by the time you have had just a few sips, it becomes tiring, as if the only remaining dominating flavor is its sweetness, and there is very little other fragrance left. In contrast, a good espresso or latte drink maintains a strong fragrance all the way.<br /><br />However, it is an energy drink, so it is unfair to compare it with espresso or latte on the taste department. I'm just reviewing on this so readers may have proper expectations.<br /><br />The convenience: C+<br /><br />You shouldn't buy this just for its convenience, which is lacking for this product. It isn't easy to prepare this drink at all. For a hot drink, for example, it takes many steps, including mixing, shaking, microwave, stirring, microwave again, and shaking again. It isn't terribly difficult to do if you really want to have the drink, but frankly, I find it easier to prepare real espresso on my automatic espresso machine.<br /><br />In addition, it can be quite a messy experience to have this drink. Must be because it's a protein drink, the container becomes very dirty and very difficult to clean even if you try to clean it right away.<br /><br />The nutrition: Don't know. Supposedly good.<br /><br />But to be fair, I believe most people buy this product for healthy reasons, not for its sheer taste or convenience. I'm not exactly sure how it performs in the energy department, as I have no trustworthy way to measure, but the nutritional ingredients in this drink would indicate that it is far more nutritious than regular coffee."

I don't give it five stars because when its made by the directions it really is only mediocre.  But make it with 14oz of skim milk and pour it over ice it is as fantastic as the other reviews rave.  I don't recommend blending it with ice it separates in more powerful blenders and gets a bad tasting froth.

I then tried Click as recommended by the good folks at BTV ([...]) and I was hooked. It tastes great, like a mocha from Starbucks but with only 120 calories per serving. I got 15 grams of protein. I got a buttload of vitamins and minerals as a bonus and I cannot recommend this highly enough. The energy boost works well since I substitute a Click for breakfast.

Before purchasing I had been using another whey protein powder that was NOT very tasty, but none of them ever are, they are just a recovery drink for after I run. So, I was curious to see if this one would be any different as so many were saying.<br /><br />They are right, it has a wonderful strong coffee taste, not bitter, no aftertaste and I had no problems with mixing it in the CLICK shaker that I purchased with this.  I like the size of the CLICK shaker, its small & measures easily ~ my other shaker for the health food store is too big. I'm not sure why others say it doesn't mix well, since I had no problems.  I did try to put it in my coffee to see how it would taste & it was a no go. It did not mix in hot coffee very well, but then again, that's not what it's meant for. I do use room temp bottled water when mixing, as I am a freak of nature & do not care for cold water, but, for the review, I chilled after mixing & it stayed mixed up and maintained it's great flavor. If you add PB2 expected very small ""nutty"" residue to remain from the PB2 and not from the CLICK. This is not an issue, just worth mentioning.<br /><br />Energy rush is not so prevalent for me, but I can see where someone could be speeded up with this drink, so if you high blood pressure I do not recommend this. I do NOT recommend this for kids or teens because of that fact. I just like the good coffee taste in my protein drink. I do recommend the PB2 for a healthy additive to this protein drink as well."

Outrageous!!**<br /><br />These brown rice cakes are one of the best sources of clean carbohydrates you'll find. Nothing but brown rice. They are also great because they are ready to eat out of the package. Anyone that's concerned about their diet knows that it's difficult to find clean carbs that are low on the glycemic index and that is convenient to eat. This is one of the only items that really covers all those bases. In fact, talk to any serious bodybuilder (they are the most extreme dieters of all the athletes) and they will tell you that these are a staple of their diet, especially when they're prepping for a show.<br /><br />Some people here complain about the fact that they crumble. That is due to the fact that there is nothing in them to make them stick together! In fact, I'm surprised that they stick together at all.<br /><br />Others say that they don't taste that great and that they're bland. Well, again; it's just brown rice! Nothing more.<br /><br />If you're looking for something that tastes fantastic and that sticks together like glue, get some rice crispy treats. But, if you want clean carbs that are low on the glycemic index, and that are convenient and ready to eat, this stuff is pretty much the best there is."

The bar is a mix of dried fruit, brown rice crisps, and hemp nuts, and the flavors of these manage to remain relatively distinct as the bar has not been blended into a homogenous mass.

I usually eat Banana or Apple Lara bars, but Lara bars are heavy on dates, and have a dense sticky texuture.  Alpsnacks provide a nice change, and can stave off hunger for a long time.  This is likely due to the high protein content of hemp nuts.<br /><br />The Alpsnack's biggest fault might be the texture, which is not fully crunchy - semi soft rice crisps aren't ideal, and the bars are mildly crumbly - but I think this a natural result of the Alpsnack being a packaged product.  Additionally, the flavor is a bit unusual, probably due to the hemp nuts.<br /><br />Overall, an excellent product, one of the few energy bars I have seen with a low sugar (and salt) content in addition to mainly unprocessed ingredients.

I am therefore frugal by design, because I do like to save a little of what I make.  That means that I rarely buy my lunch in the company-sponsored cafeteria, or at a local (sit down or take-out) restaurant.  I bring my lunch to work every day in the guise of Campbell's Chunky Soup in an 18.6 oz can.<br /><br />Campbell's Chunky Soup comes in a number of different varieties not all of which I enjoy, but I do enjoy most, including Campbell's ""Chunky Grilled Chicken w/ Vegetables and Pasta,"" the subject of this review.  The soup brand, whose tag line used to be ""so thick you could eat it with a fork, but bring a spoon because you'll want to get every drop,""  is actually quite tasty, much more so than Progresso Soup, which I find (very) bland in comparison.  And Campbell's Chunky Soup is good for you; most of the varieties have vegetables and lean cuts of meat, and are low in fat and contain at least 2 grams of dietary fiber.<br /><br />""Chunky Grilled Chicken w/ Vegetables and Pasta"" contains (2) servings with 100 calories and 2 grams of fat per serving.  Loaded with generous bite sized portions of chicken, pasta, and vegetables, the ""Soup That Eats Like a Meal,"" is enough to satisfy me for a few hours and the average cost is only $1.59 per can at my local Target Super Store.  How is that for an inexpensive lunch?  But my local Target and Jewel does not carry all of the varieties, but enough so that I can partake in a different flavor every day of the work week; on average I eat four cans of soup a week for lunch.<br /><br />Nutritional Information<br /><br />Ingredients: chicken stock, water, cooked chicken meat, carrots, potatoes, cooked enriched pasta, corn, diced tomatoes, and green beans; contains less than 2% of the following: celery, red peppers, salt, and dehydrated onions.<br /><br />Servicing information: One serving (1 Cup) of ""Chunky Grilled Chicken w/ Vegetables and Pasta"" contains 100 Calories, 2 grams of fat (including 0.5 grams of saturated fat), 15mg of Cholesterol, 880mg of Sodium, 15 grams of carbohydrates, 2 grams of dietary fiber, 3 grams of sugar, and 8 grams of protein.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />There is always plenty of Campbell's Chucky Soup in the pantry at my house.  It is by-and-large the only kind I buy and ""Chunky Grilled Chicken w/ Vegetables and Pasta""figure highly on my shopping list each week.  Low in calories and fat, ""Chunky Grilled Chicken w/ Vegetables and Pasta"" is a tasty alternative to burger and fries, and even a sandwich.

565865,B0002X8HB4,A1NHFBR0X9892B,C. Rice,2,2,4,1337644800,My Experience  With This Treat,"After reading some of these reviews, I thought I'd comment on how I use this. I have a smallish (about 22 lbs) mixed breed dog who is a strong chewer. I started using a medium sized treat ball and everlasting treats when he was about 10 months old, right after I rescued him. I use this only with the treat ball -- I would never give him a whole treat and let him eat it in one session.  I put some kibble or some small treats in the ball, with the everlasting treat only on one side.  The kibble comes out fairly easily, but slowly enough so he still has to work for it and so he still has fun. The treats are a little larger and don't come out so easily. He's learned that chewing on the treat, pressing down on the ball, enable the treats to dispense. Once the kibble or treats are gone, he chews and licks the everlasting treat. Eventually, after several weeks, he manages to consume enough so there is a hold in the center of the treat, and at that point I usually take the everlasting treat out, break it in half, and let him have it, one half at a time.<br /><br />It used to be that he would chew and lick the treat until he got bored, but he has now learned how to get the treat out. I've never actually seen him do this, so I don't know exactly how he does it, but I now take it away from him after I've decided he's had enough.<br /><br />A couple of notes:  I think the smaller treat ball was recommended for a dog his size, but I got the medium because he's such a strong chewer.  I'm glad I did, as the smaller ball wouldn't have lasted long.  I do think this is an excellent toy/treat when used the way I use it. The treat isn't particularly nutritious, but if it's consumed over a period of weeks, it shouldn't be too harmful. Also, when it's filled with kibble, the dog is working for his food and, if you're having problems with your dog eating too fast, this will slow him or her down."

The treats were out of the balls within minutes and demolished in under 30 minutes. I had put several smaller treats into the ball as well, so after they finished the larger treats, they managed to be entertained by trying to get the small treats out. There hasn't been much that the pack hasn't been able to figure out.<br /><br />We regularly give them fresh deer bones as treats. The wolf will strip the meat while the shepherd will eat the bones, so I didn't expect these treats to be a true challenge for their jaw pressure and mental abilities. I will continue to get them and try other various tricks out. Some include putting the disc in upside down and adding peanut butter or other purees into the balls. The treats may not last long, but the balls will allow for some creative training."

If you have a giant breed, this whole line isn't really for you. My 40lbs Aussie who is a moderate chewer, is about the large ball's limit and once she pops the treat out, the remainder is gone in less than 5 minutes. If you have a tiny dog, get the right size. They aren't going to be able to handle the large. They need to be able to gnaw at it, which they won't be able to do on the larger balls.<br /><br />Third: These are probably the least repugnant smelling of the discs, to me, anyway. It just smells like chicken broth when the dog gets going on it. I expected the Vanilla Mint ones to be better, but have found these are the least offensive."

I purchased it for my 7 month old pit bull, who is always into something and very highly food motivated.  Prior to the everlasting treat ball her favorite toy was the Chuckle, made by Premier.  The advantage to the chuckle is that I could fill it with her food for a nutritious but fun toy.  After a few months though, she learned how to get all the food out in under 10 minutes and I needed to find something else to occupy her while I focused on other things.<br /><br />She was just a couple of pounds over 40 pounds when I purchased the treat ball.  Although the large looked too big for her, it was recommended for her size so I went with that one.  Now that I've seen her playing with it I can tell that the medium would have been too small.<br /><br />The first time she got her paws on it, she chewed on the treat for six hours straight!  I actually had to take it away from her a few times and make her drink some water because I was afraid she'd make herself sick.  The discs weren't completely gone at the end of her play-fest, they really are ""everlasting.""  I usually give her the treat ball with both sides covered in their treats.  Her favorite is the barbecue, but it is also the darkest and will show up on fabric.  We've tried the chicken & liver too and had positive receptions to both.<br /><br />Even after playing with this for a month I can still get a good hour to myself without having to worry about her getting in to trouble when I let her play with it.  I've also tried squeezing some cheese into the center hole for her to lick and she loves this as well!  I think peanut butter would be another excellent choice.  After about a month she has found a way to pop the treats out once in a while, but it seems to be by accident because she doesn't do it every time.  Even after she pops the treats out they still last a long time.  If she doesn't get them out herself, I pop them out when there is only a rim left and give them to her to chew on.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this toy four stars instead of five is that I wish the holes in the center were smaller to accommodate her dog food or treats.  Small/med. treats fall out too quickly.  It does seem to be sized well for their Every Flavor treats, but we haven't really tried those so I can't comment on them.<br /><br />For anyone put off by the cost, this product is TOTALLY worth its weight in gold!"

It pops out of the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012V1G0Y"">StarMark Everlasting Treat Ball, Large</a> a little sooner than I would like, but, considering I did have a hard time putting two treats in there I would have to say if they made it harder to come out I may not be able to put it in.<br /><br />The very first time one treat lasted a good five minutes, on the second attempt maybe more like four minutes and that is just because he knows how hard to bite down now. Either way with the whole package I would say it is a good investment as a once in a while kind of treat for when he does something special or we just need silence to watch a show (30 minutes to 1 hour, not a 2-hour series premier).<br /><br />My dog is pretty mellow when he has his exercise, but, when it is missed this can help to get some quiet.

He loves these things so much that I have to put refills in his ball while he is outside doing his business or I can't even get enough space in the kitchen to pop the new one in before he's trying to take it back!

True to their breeds, our pups get in an occasional gnawing moment, but for the most part they have to lick and nibble their way through their treat. Which means when we leave for an extended time, they are honorably occupied, not bored, and not getting into mischief.<br /><br />3) The ball itself is made of a soft-ish, somewhat pliable material, and yet appears to be indestructible. Time will tell.<br /><br />4) A variety of flavors. We purchased each of the available flavors to learn which would ""win"", and immediately discovered that all flavors send our pups into exited expectation when they see their ball coming.<br /><br />5) You can put your own treats inside the ball itself, but it looks like a tough nut for any dog to get to.<br /><br />Con: and this could be a good thing: it's hard getting a treat into the ball unless you have strong hands/wrists, or a smooth ended spoon handle to help peel the retaining edge of the treat ball opening over the edge of the treat.

Petsmart and other pet stores sell a blue ball. You stick a treat on both sides of that one. I purchased one and promptly had to return it...because on the car ride home my dog was able to get chunks of the blue plastic ripped off. I at that time decided to never purchase one of these again. However, I was recently at Pet Supplies Plus getting my sheltie groomed and I wanted to get a treat for my heavy chewer since she got left at home and was very unhappy. While browsing the treat insert toys(kong, etc) I noticed the orange ball of this that holds one cookie and small kibble or treats on the other side. I promptly dismissed it because of it being an everlasting toy. I continued to browse and when I realized that we either have or have tried pretty much every other treat stuffed toy. I decided to try it since if she ripped it apart they would refund my money and I would know if it was good or not.<br /><br />I got home and man oh man did I have a happy dog. She still has not even punctured the rough rubber. Unlike other reviewers stating that the treat came out easily in the blue ball this one did not. Once she had cleaned the middle out I could not get the treat out to save my life. I had to use a meat mallet to bust it apart. She does, however, get any kibble or other treats out of the backside very easily. We only put treats in the back when we need to get her interested again.<br /><br />Just to elaborate on the chewing power of my dog. She can eat a full rawhide in just an hour or so. (a large rawhide with the tied ends, she is 26 pounds). She has also demolished a couple of kong's and ate through the rope on the tug-a-jug toy. She also completely chewed trough the Twist-and-treat by the same company.<br /><br />The only other flaw I see with this product is the rubber. It is a lint/hair magnet. I hate picking it up and am constantly washing it because it picks up all the dog hair and lint possible...On the reverse side I love that it is not a toy that peanut butter or other semi solids work best in. I hate putting them in the kong because it leaves a very bad smell and clean up if not taken away promptly and cleaned.<br /><br />Onto the cookies. They are very hard and last her a couple hours of constant chewing. I have a large treat ball even though she is weighted into the medium. I find the oversized toys help prevent her getting a good grip and ripping it apart. She seems to love the flavor and loves when we put a new treat in. I do find them at a very good price compared to other refill treats.<br /><br />Over all I find it one of the best treat filled toy buys that we have made. It has out lasted any of the Kong's...even the black ones. It is easier to clean and provides her with a lot of enjoyment...and us with a lot of laughter as she tries to go at it."

Most women who see this chew in person will experience a momentary impression that it resembles, yes, I'll say it, a diaphragm.  On a serious and positive note, the round chew is challenging for dogs to grasp when the chew is concave to the floor.  Hardwood makes an excellent shuffleboard surface and my dogs kick and chase it for fun.  The exterior is somehow resistant to dog saliva, so messy floor streaks and drool spots were surprisingly absent.  My two dogs kick it, chase it and trot about the house with these very durable chews for days.  Eventually, something possesses the dogs and they start working at dismantling the 'bone'.  It literally takes hours of dedicated canine chomping and gnawing for the chew to be reduced to crumbs.  The final word is that there are no intestinal after effects in what I have observed in my two English Springers. These ""Everlasting Treats"" make it possible for me to sit down and watch a film in solitude. - an activity long ago lost by any 'Springer parent'."

No matter where I've been or what I'm doing, this is some tasty goodness.  It's moist, easy to chew, with peppers on the beef visible through the bag!  So far, I've tried all variations of the Country Cut.  Barbecue and Teriyaki are sweet and true to their flavors.  Honey Pepper is fairly sweet with that black pepper kick all over it.  Mild is exactly as it says, mild(it would be like Spicy with no spicy hehe).  Chipotle Habanero, though, is a whole different story.  It is VERY spicy and the burn will stay in your mouth for a while longer as expected so be careful.  Compared to buying Jack Link's for half the price(and almost half the flavor IMO), this is really good deal."

My favorite flavor is the Spicy, which has an honest to goodness heat factor, enough to satisfy any ""chilehead"".  Apparently, the ""country cut"" jerky style signifies that it is moister than the rest of BB's offerings, and I'm all for that.  Moist, yes, with a marvelous mouthfeel, cut into succulent strips and hunks.  Another winner is the Honey Pepper flavor, which masterfully mates sweetness and heat in a winning combination.  Teriyaki is O.K., but it's never been a favorite of mine, so my opinion is biased in that arena.  I was buying World Kitchens jerky (at ten or so dollars a pound it's probably the best jerky bargain out there), but Buffalo Bill's is, in my opinion, far superior.  Just about double the price of World Kitchens (an eight ounce bag is about twelve dollars), but well worth it.  I would recommend only buying the large eight ounce bags (BB's also offers two smaller sizes), because, if you're like me, you'll munch through this stuff quick."

Seagrave ""YorkieDog""",12,12,5,1293840000,Great for my picky eaters!,"I have had all of my dogs on this formula for almost a year.<br /><br />I own a retail store and do a lot of research into what dog foods are best for your pet. I always take ingredients into account when considering a dog food for my dogs. When it comes right down to it, it doesn't matter how great the food if your pet will not eat it. I have also come to realize that every dog is different and what might be considered undesirable for one dog might actually be best for another.<br /><br />It took me a very long while to try the Yorkshire Terrier Formula 28 because of the corn gluten. My dogs were very picky eaters and basically grazers, eating only here and there. Once my dogs tried Yorkshire Terrier Formula 28, you would have thought I had fed them candy as they would consume all that I placed before them.<br /><br />I have 5 Yorkies and 2 poodles - this formula is not just for Yorkies. (I do not breed - they are simply my best little friends.)<br /><br />With the Yorkies, I no longer had to worry about whether they were getting enough to eat. As they stayed on this formula, I began to notice silkier coats and over all well-being not only in appearance but in energy. One of my Yorkies had a very thin coat, since being on this formula her coat has come in thicker and absolutely shines regardless of whether or not she needs a bath or a brushing.<br /><br />The 2 poodles are rescues. The oldest being around 20 years old. She will not eat anything but Yorkshire Terrier Formula 28. She is all bones with zero muscle tone due to ill treatment before she came to me, but I don't have to worry about trying to get her to eat on this formula. Before feeding this food it was hit or miss as to whether or not she would eat. She weighs 3.5 pounds so I worry about her a great deal.<br /><br />The other poodle is young. He came to me with a multitude of ailments, mostly stomach or parasite related. All the dog foods that had meat as the first and 2nd ingredients that also excluded corn, wheat and soy would go right through him. When I tried this formula on him, it was to me a miracle. His mobility problems ceased, no more stool problems - he absorbed the food better as stool size was greatly decreased. He also gained the much need 2 pounds.<br /><br />Overall, my dogs love the taste. They find the shape easier to chew as well. They will turn their heads if I offer them other choices.<br /><br />I wish it was corn free, but it works for them and that is what counts.<br /><br />The largest bag size is limited to 10 lbs.<br /><br />As I said all dogs are different and not all Yorkies are gonna love this formula. I raved about this food to my best friend and had her order from Amazon. She wanted to give her 3 dogs something new as they seemed bored with their food, but when it arrived they would have nothing to do with it. They wanted their Evanger's Pheasant & Brown Rice back immediately! (Which was a favorite of my dogs too, until Royal Canin.) So I would advise that you try a small bag first, even though not as cost effective, to see if your little ones like before getting the 10 lb bag.<br /><br />Full Ingredient List:<br />Chicken meal, brown rice, rice, chicken fat, corn gluten meal, barley, wheat gluten meal, natural chicken flavor, powdered cellulose, dried beet pulp (sugar removed), anchovy oil (source of EPA/DHA), dried brewers yeast, potassium chloride, soya oil, fructo-oligosaccharides, sodium tripolyphosphate, salt, calcium carbonate, taurine, dried brewers yeast extract (source of mannan-oligosaccharides), dried egg product, choline chloride, DL-methionine, Vitamins [DL-alpha tocopherol acetate (source of vitamin E), inositol, niacin supplement, L-ascorbyl-2-polyphosphate (source of vitamin C), D-calcium pantothenate, biotin, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), riboflavin supplement (vitamin B2), thiamine mononitrate (vitamin B1), vitamin A acetate, folic acid, vitamin B12 supplement, vitamin D3 supplement], magnesium oxide, Trace Minerals [zinc proteinate, zinc oxide, ferrous sulfate, manganese proteinate, copper proteinate, copper sulfate, manganous oxide, calcium iodate, sodium selenite], glucosamine hydrochloride, marigold extract (Tagetes erecta L.), tea (green tea extract), L-carnitine, chondroitin sulfate, rosemary extract, preserved with natural mixed tocopherols (source of vitamin E) and citric acid.<br />_______________________________________<br /><br />In my opinion, food ingredients to always avoid are : Animal Digest & UNKNOWN fats and oils which are NOT in this formula : )<br /><br />This formula works for my dogs.

Her coat has turned glossy again as when she was younger. The dry skin is gone as well, although that really was due to her laying in front of the oil heater or the fireplace stove.

The box contained 12 bars, but it was severely crushed during shipment, which destroyed the 12th bar. I know that the damage occurred during shipment because the outside box in which Amazon shipped the meal-bar box was crushed like an accordion, worse than the boxes of AdvantEdge bars ever were.<br /><br />So, my review of the Kashi bars is pretty the same as for the AdvantEdge bars. Kashi bars are a good product, but they're sometimes melted or crushed during shipment.<br /><br />With 11 usable Kashi bars in the box I just received, Amazon's lower price still makes them slightly cheaper than they are at the supermarket.

Seattle's Best French Roast has been our coffee of choice for at least the last five, but sometimes it is so hard to find. Only one grocery chain in our area still carries Seattle's Best and often the space is loaded with everything but French Roast. After spending a recent morning driving around to four stores without success I checked Amazon and found it. The bags have changed, Seattle's Best no longer comes in the red bag, but rather bags in bright colors with a white circle and # on the front. French Roast is now in a purple bag with the #5 in the white circle. I did get the new bag from Amazon. I dislike the new design, but at least they didn't mess with the coffee itself.

This quickly became my daily coffee fix.  Recently, however, the original packaging changed (I understand the company was bought by Starbucks), and so did the coffee.  Now called Level 5, the coffee seems OK when brewed immediately after opening the bag, but beginning the next day or so after opening, a freshly brewed batch tastes burnt and has an odd chemical flavor.  Like another reviewer, I cleaned my pot and tried a different coffee maker (one at work), but the coffee still tastes bad. I have now tried all three bags from my last order, and each makes the same unpleasant coffee.  To compound this disppointing change in coffee quality, the price on Amazon has gone up from $18 (with free shipping via Amazon Prime) to $41.95 + shipping costs for a 3-pack from an outside supplier.

I bought the frosting starter with the white chocolate raspberry add-in, and it nearly ruined my cake. The frosting consistency is way off - it's drippy and doesn't hold well to the cake. Looks awful. But worse, the taste was unpalatable. It tasted like cough medicine and sugar substitute. I couldn't bring myself to put it on my daughter's birthday cake, so I fiddled with it for about 20 minutes until it was edible and a little thicker. The cake ended up being eaten well by the kids, but the adults mostly scraped the icing off. Even after all my fiddling with it, it was only slightly better. Duncan Hines regular icing is great, in all varieties. But stay far away from Frosting Creations. I wish I'd dumped it in the trash and started from scratch.

I used it first with Yonanas mixer (and chocolate one too) and it worked out rather well with bananas and berries (very little berries, or otherwise the taste clashes) One little critics I have is the packaging. I had trouble opening it, so in the end I had to cut it. Now it sits open and I would rather have it tight closed. Any ideas? (except zip lock bag)? Next time I think I will buy it in a jar.

Simply mix this stuff with water and you've got a spreadable substitute!<br />This product really shines in a myriad of ingredients-- frostings become fantastically peanut buttery without heaviness or an additional caloric load. Smoothies become creamy shakes. Make peanut butter cookies with this as your flour and your mind will be blown with peanut butter presence.<br />The aroma and the hint of peanut butter flavor are the stars in PB2. Eating them side by side is like drinking half and half, and then expecting 2% to taste the same. If this type of comparison is hard for you to notice, then you'll love PB2!<br /><br />But remember, it's NOT peanut butter. Don't go expecting it to have the mouth-feel of full fat, smooth ground peanuts. Just relish the fact that this product exists, and use it where it really shines.<br /><br />P.S.

Sure its not as good as peanut butter but when is a low calorie version ever better than the original?  It's a great snack and takes away my cravings instantly.  I can eat it anytime of the day without feeling guilty.  I try to keep it between 1 and 2 servings which is just 45-90 calories.  The additional protein it gives me is a bonus.

I absolutely crave this stuff - So, if you love your PB&J but don't want to trade in for a larger pair of pants, then PB2 is the way to go.  It really does taste great.  When it comes in these 16 oz. bags like this, they're a bit messy. Powder seems to get everywhere.

I think that while it is not quite the same as normal name brand peanut butter, but when you compare it to Skippy or Planter's brands - the two I had in my house to compare it to - this peanut butter has 75% fewer calories.  There is no way that I would rate this as being 75% less satisfying, so if your goal is to find a substitute for peanut butter that is better in terms of overall calories, this is the way to go.  It might take some experimenting to get it to a consistency you like.  The recommended 2 tbsp powder to 2 tbsp water was a bit thick for me.  Finally, I would highly recommend this to anyone who uses peanut butter as an ingredient, as opposed to just eating something with peanut butter on it.  The powder dissolves much more easily than you can get actual peanut butter to mix into a sauce.  I particularly have enjoyed it in milk shakes."

566164,B004P4POZ8,ANMA1H8LGEVBF,"KeithNYC ""KeithInNYC""",90,94,5,1319587200,"UPDATE 07/12:  OMG, this is AWESOME!!!! Finally a really good alternative to high fat peanut butter","Guys: Although this may not have the exact taste of a typical commercial brand peanut butter out of the jar, it is VERY CLOSE.  THIS IS THE ONE THAT SATISFIES A CRAVING FOR CREAMY PEANUT BUTTER without all the fatty oil.. It has no chemical or weird aftertaste (it's the most peanut-nutty tasting alternative out there which I've tried), and you really can adjust the consistency based on the amount of liquid you add.  Although  I previously favored the ""Better-n-Peanut Butter"" brand sold here <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KUQG3O"">Better N Peanut Butter, Better N Peanut Butter, Orig Lf, 16.00 OZ (Pack of 12)</a>and at Trader Joe's (which needs no mixing or preparation and has a real peanut butter texture), I must admit that the taste of ""better n peanut butter"" is not nearly as good as PB2 ( ""Better n Peanut Butter"" is less peanut-y and does have an odd sort of after taste) and it needs to be refrigerated after opening or it gets moldy (trust me.....yuck).<br /><br />Anyway, back to this product:PB2.  It has a very good peanut buttery taste and if you're cooking with it or mixing it in drinks or smoothies (like a banana smoothie), the texture is a non-issue. And having it in these 1 lb packages makes it much more affordable than buying the small jars sold here or directly from PB2's website (where they add $10 shipping).  And if you get at least three bags at Amazon, it qualifies for free shipping (it works out to about $8.70/lb). I also ordered the chocolate which is also good (not a strong chocolatey taste, more like a hint of cocoa), but my favorite is still the plain PB2.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br />Guys: I just tried another product from Byrd Mill and searched under peanut flour product (basically peanut butter with the oils removed as well) that's also very good  (it's cheaper than the PB2 product here if you buy the 5 1lb. option....I ordered -1- 5 lb bag and the total price with shipping was approx. $32.65 (therefore about $6.50/lb). The package comes in about 4 days after you order, but the one negative is that it is not vacuum sealed.  It's in a plastic bag with a twisty tied around it and then placed in a large paper bag with a folding top (the kind of bag that coffee beans come in, but bigger). In order to keep it fresh, I use about 1 lb. at a time and then vacuum seal the rest.  They also sell larger and smaller quantities at slightly steeper discount with little change in shipping. You have an option of getting a dark roast (more peanut-y) or light roast (less peanut-y tasting) and either 28% fat left in (at 6g/serving) or 12% (at 3g fat per serving).  I buy the dark roasted, 12% fat.  It is definitely more peanut-y than PB2 and is smoother and creamier in texture. The only big difference from the PB2 product (which I prefer, others may not....) is that Byrd Mill does not have any salt and sugar added (it's just pure roasted de-fatted peanut flour) so you'll most definitely want to add a little salt (maybe even a little honey) to the mixture to suit your taste if your using it plain (like on a sandwich, or with crackers or right on a spoon.  So if you find yourself snacking on peanut butter every day to satisfy your peanut butter cravings, go ahead and try this."

Based on the glowing reviews,  I opted for the large size, which proved to be the right choice.  This stuff is FABULOUS.<br /><br />It's a very fine, dry powder with such an intense peanut flavor that very little goes a long way.  A 2-tablespoon (12 gram) serving has only 45 calories and 1.5 grams of fat, but reconstituted with 2 tablespoons of sugar-free grape jam (instead of water), that's enough to coat 2 slices of toast for a sinlessly delicious PB & J.  I've also used it successfully to make no-guilt Chinese cold peanut noodle, peanut sauce for chicken, and substituted PB2 everywhere I'd used peanut butter or peanuts in the past.

I also used it mixed with a tiny bit of water as a dip for apples as a much lower fat alternative to apples and peanut butter.

I was against it from the start, but I will make my review fair.<br />The product is not peanut butter, if you expect peanut butter than you will be disappointed. It tastes like peanut butter. If I could compare it to something it is like eating a regular Oreo and a reduced fat Oreo. The reduced Oreo tastes like and Oreo, but really just leaves you wanting the real thing. This product is no different. If you mask it will jelly and bread, the off taste becomes less noticeable, but there in lies the problem. You have to add more calories back in to make this product taste better. There by negating the fact that you have cut calories. As I explained to my wife after we both decided this product was not for us. The problem with any peanut butter food is normally everything but the peanut butter. The fat is the healthiest part. You wouldn't eat omega free fish because it's lower in fat, why would you do the same to peanut butter?<br />The only way I could recommend this is if you are doing a starvation sort of diet (i.e. you eating this with celery and water). If you are doing a healthy diet don't cut out the peanut butter of your PB&J, cut out the jelly first and then the grain. I eat again ""regular"" non-hydrogenated peanut butter will celery, now there is a healthy food.<br /><br />Pros<br />+lower calorie<br />+great price here on amazon<br />+does taste similar to peanut butter<br /><br />Cons<br />-less nutritional value<br />-doesn't taste like real peanut butter<br /><br />I will give it four stars if you are doing a starvation sort of diet, which I don't recommend, but it does taste alright for a lot less calories.

I also love it in smoothies, which usually require a ton of peanut butter to even perceive the taste of peanut, but not with this... A few teaspoons and a frozen banana with almond milk and you've got a smoothie to die for without the guilt.  I'm definately reordering this product.  I liked the PB2 Chocolate as well, but it's not as versatile as the PB2.

566184,B004P4POZ8,A1XETKNYKPBFAL,"K. Carlson ""KC in MN""",0,0,5,1328227200,Yum! And less fat and calories!,"Love it!<br />Is it the same as good ole fashioned peanut butter? Ok, probably not. But it's VERY CLOSE! If you can handle all the fat and calories from the real stuff, go ahead and stick with it. However, if you LOVE peanut butter, but find you are needing to cut back, PB2 is the way to go!<br />It's a little pricey. I think there are places to get it cheaper, but I went with Amazon since I was ordering other items and getting free shipping.<br />Mixing it with water and reconstituting it works fine, although a little grainy. And many have already commented that it doesn't amount to much, making it hard to SLATHER on stuff. Since I'm not making peanut butter sandwiches with this stuff, it's not a big deal to me.<br />It's not as sweet as many PB's, it's definitely more like a natural peanut butter in flavor. Personally, I love it for mixing it into my greek yogurt. YUM! A little extra protein and it tastes like a creamy peanut butter mousse. I love it!<br />I haven't tried mixing it in oatmeal yet, but that's next! I started mixing the regular stuff into my oatmeal every morning last summer, but realized I was taking in too many calories and fat along with my regular diet. Soooo, ready to try this option!<br />Great for smoothies or protein shakes too!"

I was hesitant, having had less than stellar luck with low-calorie peanut butter products (Walden farms, better n' peanut butter, etc).  I also am adverse to products whose ingredients I don't recognize.  But this one really, really delivers.  It has the same taste as regular peanut butter with a slightly fluffier texture. Ingredients: Roasted peanuts, sugar, and salt.  That's it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />GREAT taste<br />Very low-calorie<br />16-oz package is a waaaaay better deal than elsewhere<br />Much more versatile than regular creamy PB<br /><br />Cons:<br />Needs to be mixed with water, which means another bowl to wash<br />Can't eat it out of a jar with a spoon (which, if you're dieting, might also be a pro!) :]<br /><br />Ways I use it:<br />Sandwiches (of course)<br />In cookies, cakes, brownies, and other places where the consistency of PB is tricky<br />With my whey protein shakes in the morning (chocolate whey powder or cocoa powder, PB2, almond or regular milk, ice, makes a reeses cup milkshake!)<br /><br />I shop on amazon almost daily and never review products, but I really, really love this one.  Very highly recommended."

We make smoothies with the PB2 chocolate using frozen bananas, ice, skim milk and PB2 chocolate.  Delicious!!!  Tip for sandwiches - with the PB2 we mix 6 tablespoons of powder with 3 tablespoons of water (3 points).  When using it in the kids sandwiches, I add one teaspoon of regular peanut butter.

She loves it.  Says it tastes just like peanut butter (and that was coming from when she just ate it off a spoon and only mixed with water).  I like it also, but I still think all natural peanut butter tastes better, but this is great for smoothies because the ""peanut butter"" doesn't stick to the blades making a very messy clean up and it gives the perfect amount of peanut taste.

I'm not sure which I'll choose long term.<br /><br />UPDATE:  PB2 is my first choice all the time now.  Not having the oil is worth the little sweetness that is present in the PB2, and the salt tastes about the same as the salt in the Smuckers Natural.  It's very convenient to mix as needed, and it really is just as good as regular peanut butter.  And one serving is only one Weight Watcher point.  3/15/3012"

566202,B004P4POZ8,A2ZJRC1DW3THKC,Mike,1,2,4,1332460800,Great on a cut...value not so much,"To get this out of the way: No, this does not taste exactly like peanut butter. It is close, especially near the end where the roasted peanut taste really comes through, but unless you are strictly buying off-brand surplus peanut butter, this won't fool anyone in a blind taste test. Then again, it has a quarter of the calories of regular while maintaining a (pretty good!) semblance of the taste and texture. Note, however, that this isn't the greatest bang for your buck. While this and the smaller, peanut-butter jar size seem like they would last a while, it tends to go fast as you need to mix two tablespoons of what is a relatively loosely-packed powder with a tablespoon of water. Despite that, it is diet-friendly, a decent amount of protein, and a staple of my cutting diet. Definitely get this if you aren't pauper-poor."

I toyed with the idea of bringing a small jar of peanut butter but it was heavy and there's always the probability of leakage. I was looking around Amazon one day and saw this. It got really good reviews so I tried it.  My fellow reviewers were absolutely right ... for dehydrated peanut butter, this tasted almost like the real thing. Now I'm not comparing it to Skippy of Jiffy because those peanut butters have a lot of salt and sugar in them. I buy the all natural peanut butter (no sugar or salt added) and when hydrated, this PB2 was almost as tasty as the hydrated all-natural version.<br /><br />It has instructions for the water to power ratio but I like to just mix to my preference. If I feel like a little creamier / smoother, then I add more water and vice versa.

I'm a dietitian and recommend this to my patients who need to follow low fat diets but don't want to give up peanut butter.

I follow the Weight Watchers 2012 plan and this stuff is VERY 'point' friendly. Not to mention it tastes wonderful! Who would have thought? Needless to say, I mix it up in vanilla yogurt and add berries or I mix it up in chocolate pudding and add bananas.  I make smoothies with this stuff, and I will also mix it with water to make a creamy peanut butter for a nice peanut butter sandwich! The 1 lb bag is the way to go, especially if you love peanut butter! I have turned SO many people on to this stuff where I work that it's kind of a running joke now. Everyone loves PB2 and most importantly, can't believe HOW GOOD it tastes! Another bonus: 5 grams of protein in just two tablespoons! Awesome!"

My typical morning begins with a bowl of oatmeal which I like to mix about 150 calories worth of peanut butter into. I recently discovered this product and decided to give it a shot in hopes that I could shave a few calories off of my oatmeal and this product didn't disappoint! I admit it lacks the creaminess you get from real peanut butter but all the flavor is there at a fraction of the calories and fat! My morning oatmeal which used to be approx. 370 calories is now down to around 240 thanks to PB2! I haven't tried using it in anything else just yet but this one change in my diet has made the product worth it to me!

My son is a vegan endurance athlete and needs a lot of protein to fuel his workouts. He adds PB2 to almost every meal. His favorite is oatmeal with PB2 and bananas. Yum! It tastes great and is reasonably priced on Amazon. Since we have Amazon Prime, it's a breeze to just click a couple buttons and sit back to wait for our PB2 delivery in two days. Definitely a product we'll be ordering MUCH more of."

It tastes soooooo good, and because it's low in fat and calories, I can have this as a snack without feeling too bad.  I also mix this with chocolate soy milk for a quick drink.<br /><br />I don't like it as much in a sandwich, but it satiates that craving.  It was a great thing to try, but I probably wouldn't purchase this again only because something about removing healthy fats kinda gives me pause for thought.<br /><br />As a not-so-healthy option, it works great in flavoring buttercream frosting and dusting truffles for extra peanut flavor.  :)"

I thought I was just going to have to stop buying it because it was getting so out of hand.  I usually mix regular PB with Greek yogurt (the unflavored kind...it has the lowest amount of sugar) to try to lower the fat/calorie content, but I wont be doing that anymore.  This tastes just as good, if not better.  I also found that if I used yogurt instead of water, that a little bit less PB2 needs to be used.  I typically mix a little water in there, too.  For a treat, I would also put just a lil' bit of PB2 in with some Greek yogurt and maybe a bit of SF jelly and some cereal!"

Sayer,4,5,4,1331683200,"Not quite peanut butter, but a reasonable substitute","I've been on a diet and exercise program and was eating peanut butter as a snack and it started to get out of hand and I couldn't lose any weight. Well with roughly 200 calories in 2T of peanut butter, it is easy to figure out why. My trainer told me about PB2 so I got some to try and I do like it. It is NOT peanut butter, it lacks the creamy smooth taste. I guess if I had to explain what it tastes like, I would say peanut butter cookie dough - basically imagine what peanut butter would taste like mixed with flour. But given that I can eat it for 1/4 of the calories, it is a reasonable substitute when I crave peanut butter.<br /><br />As I recall, the instructions call for 2T of powder and 1T of water. I found that wasn't enough water to mix it up properly and had to put in a little extra. Over time I've found 1T of water is needed for every 1T of powder (equal parts), and that provides a creamier texture.<br /><br />If I've got a few extra calories to burn for the day, I will sometimes mix 3T of PB2, 3T of water, and 1T of real peanut butter.<br /><br />So PB2 is a great product and it is helping me meet my diet goals, but I wish it tasted more like real peanut butter. I haven't tried it in smoothies or anything like that (because I don't drink them), but I can see how that could be good if you enjoy them. I've ordered some of the chocolate flavored and I look forward to trying it."

No. Is the consistency the same as a full fat peanut butter? No.  Does it taste good and act as a good substitute? Yes!  I've made PBJs with this and it is not quite the same (but good), PB and honey--I don't advise it, Thai peanut sauce--excellent..  The best use of this product is in smoothies with bananas, blueberries, protein powder, and coco.  I've ordered this product twice and will continue to do so but it is by no means Jiffy in a powdered form."

With PB2 I don't need to worry about using the product quickly before it turns rancid.  I can measure my portions much more easily.  PB2 is so much easier to take with me for lunch or snacks.  PB2 is only 45 calories compared it the oily stuff's 220 calories.  PB2 is great for adding into smoothies, yogurt, curries, soups, and just about anything you can think of whilst in the kitchen.

PB2 isn't a perfect replacement for peanut butter, but it has a natural taste to it, is MUCH lower in fat and calories and is very versatile.  I was pleased to see that they are now offering larger packages of this product.<br /><br />When turning PB2 into peanut butter, don't add too much water, or the consistency will be funny and the taste gets a little diluted.  In addition to using this as a peanut butter spread, I also put PB2 powder in smoothies, on cereal and with oatmeal."

Amazing!","I have difficulty controlling portion size when I eat peanut butter, which wrecks my diet, and is preventing me from losing the last 20 lbs. I need to lose. After trying the revolting Walden Farms 0 Calorie Peanut Spread, several Amazon users recommended this product. PB 2 is real peanut butter in powdered form. It's had most of the fat extracted from the peanuts. It contains just three ingredients: peanuts, salt, and sugar. It's more natural than many regular PB brands. Each 2 tbsp. serving contains 45 calories and just 1.5 g of fat (compared to 190 or 200 calories and 16 g of fat in regular PB). You mix one to two tbsp of water per two tbsp of PB2. This is one of the few diet foods that tastes the same as the regular stuff, instead of being an inferior chemical tasting imitation of the original. I mix it with sugar free syrup and spread it on an apple for a 115 calorie dessert that tastes awesome!"

The owner raved about it and offered me a sample. I was sold at first bite! I loved the clean taste without all the sugar and additives. I bought a jar and as I continued to eat it on our Daniel Fast, I just had to go on line to order more. I offered some to my 14 yr. old granddaughter and  she is sold on it too. She also thinks it tastes better than regular peanut butter.  I can have 3 TBS, get the same amount of protein with less than 68 calories. I have mixed it in oatmeal & I have added part water and part total fruit spread for a sandwich. You get all the fun with none of the guilt and it has so much nutrition! Eating this is saying goodbye to empty calories and being able to carry it with me is a great benefit. If you really care about living a healthier lifestyle, you will want to order this awesome peanut butter.  It also comes in chocolate with the same food value. I even posted it on my facebook page.

As it turns out, PB2 is quite compatible with sliced bread, or smoothies, milkshakes, ice cream, or just by the spoonful.<br /><br />This is the real deal. All of the flavor and taste of peanut butter, without all the peanut oil."

I use it as an ingredient in my homemade protein bars but also have tried it every way I can think of.  As a peanut butter junkie, I was not sure I would like this, but its great.  Mixed per the instructions with water and I think it tastes as good or better than most commercial brands and without the fat.  Okay, but I am lazy, too. I empty the original package into a glass container with a snap on lid.  I find it easier to get the product out without spilling this way.  It also makes it easy to dip bananas for each bite.  Sprinkles on vanilla or chocolate ice cream? You betcha!  Here is one that sounds weird, but don't knock it until you try it.  Mix two tbsps. powder with one tbsp. water and five or six drops of your favorite hot sauce.  Spread this over a freshly grilled hamburger and enjoy.  It sort of tastes like Thai beef satay, only better and juicier.  It is a little pricey at this size and I am hoping to find larger, bulk sizes."

However, since I was getting free shipping, I gave it a try.  At first taste, I thought it maybe needed a little more salt, but by my second taste, I was hooked on it, just as it is.  I like that I can add a tiny bit more water than it calls for and make it a little creamier, easier to spread.  I LOVE peanut butter, but almost always avoid it because of the fat and calories (even though I know ""it's a good fat"").  When you're counting calories, you just can't have 200 calories for 2T of peanut butter very often.  45 calories?  Done!

At first, I was a little leery about having to reconstitute my peanut butter but this is a very tasty alternative and the dehydration makes the product more versatile. I would suggest that you make sure that the product is well mixed or the consistency will be bumpy/powdery and not as good. Occasionally, I will add a little stevia to sweeten the mixture and make it a little more like peanut butter. Today, I am buying 6 more so I definitely recommend this product."

But --- I really like peanut butter, and how could they make it taste good and take all that oil and all those calories out? A ton of reviewers claimed it was good - but I just had to see for myself. I ordered both the regular and chocolate.  I couldn't wait to get the shipment. It came today (sooner than expected) - and I immediately mixed up the regular PB2. At first it looked like grainy stuff and water. I kept stirring - and pretty soon my spoon was coated with peanut butter - and I had a nice little mound of peanut butter in the bowl! Well - at least it looks like peanut butter - that's something! Then I tasted a little with my finger. Wait .... WHAT?? Seriously - it really IS peanut butter!! It looks like it, smells like it and tastes like it! I grew up in the mid-west, enjoying peanut butter and sweet pickle sandwiches. (Yes - sounds weird, I know - but have you tried it? Wonderful!) I'm trying to lose weight and eat healthier - and those can't be enjoyed very often. I've been using the high fiber whole grain tortillas that are only 50 calories - so I spread some PB2 down the center - and placed a few pickle slices on top. I rolled up and tasted ----- perfect! I know I'm going to love this stuff! Another thing I like to do - is just scoop a spoonful of peanut butter and eat it (we call it a ""peanut butter pop""). Well guess what - this is good enough that you can even do that! If you are used to Jiff like I am - just sprinkle a bit of Splenda in the PB2 as you mix it up for that little bit of extra sweetness! I read a few reviews by people who said PB2 wasn't anything like real peanut butter - and I have to say, I have no idea what they are talking about!! I was fully prepared to sacrifice flavor for the goal of lowering fat and calories - but I'm so excited to find out I don't have to! Oh - and the PB2 Chocolate is pretty darned good stuff too! Buy PB2 and try it for yourself - you'll find a million ways to use it, I'm sure! All I wonder - is where has this been, and why didn't I know about it? I'll be telling every nutrition conscious person I know! Happy, healthy eating!!"

That should suffice for the ""how'd you like it?"" part. It's a pretty good sub for actual pb on sandwiches, etc., (found it mixed better with a bit of hot water rather than cold) but it's at least as good if not better in smoothies. First day, I tried it with the banana as folks had suggested, but discovered I liked it even better with just cold almond milk. Since then, I've been adding a packet or two of stevia and a tablespoon of ground flax to the mixture and having it in a tall glass with ice cubes; tastes like a pb milkshake! Yum. Only slight negative is the sugar they add to the powder; would prefer if this company sold a plain pb version (with or without the salt). Other than that, it's just about perfect."

I put it on watermelon and I used to put it in my cup of vanilla ice cream.  This was in 1970 before peanut butter and ice cream was an actual flavor at ice cream parlors.  I should have patented it at that time, but what did a 10 year old girl know?<br /><br />As I got older my love for peanut butter grew and I continued to put it on all kinds of things and of course, peanut butter sandwiches.  Sometimes with jelly, sometimes with marshmallow fluff and frequently just plain peanut butter on bread!  To this day, it is still one of my favorites.  Because peanut butter is so fattening, I hardly ever eat it.....until, I discovered PB2.  Oh my goodness, what an awesome, awesome discovery.  Peanut Butter with a fraction of the calories and all of the taste.<br /><br />PB2 is dehydrated peanut butter where the fat has been squeezed out of the peanuts so what is left is pure protein, no guilt goodness!  I'm always dieting and watching my weight and PB2 has made it so much easier.  There are so many ways to eat this PB2.  I add a teaspoon to protein drinks in the morning.  I rehydrate it with water and dip carrots, apples and watermelon in it.  I mix jelly directly into the PB2 and put in inside a whole wheat tortilla and roll it up.  If you like Pad Tai, make some noodles, shred some carrots and other vegetables and toss some PB2 in and you have a nice Pad Thai.<br /><br />When mixed with water, the texture is very similar to smooth peanut butter, but a bit drier because the oil has been removed.  The taste is pure peanut.  A drop of honey can easily be added for a sweet touch.<br /><br />PB2 is easy to travel with and I always have some with me when I leave home as I like to have healthy snacks when the urge hits.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this peanut butter for anyone who loves peanut butter and is watching their weight.  With PB2, you can have your cake and eat it too!"

I also like to add a serving of it to my coffee drinks, but just know that if you mix it in with a spoon, it will eventually settle at the bottom of water based drinks. The nutritional benefit is 5g of protein per serving and a mere 40 calories (versus 180 calories for a serving of peanut butter). Unfortunately when you cut out the calories, you also cut out the heart healthy fats so I wouldn't recommend it as a complete substitute for real peanut butter if you're eating peanut butter for healthy heart reasons.

I see that some of the other posters say that they could eat a bag a day -- Ha!  I could eat a bag of these tasty little morsels at every meal, wipe my face with the bag and hope I could sneak a few more for dessert.<br /><br />One negative reviewer said that these chips are dry.  Of course they're dry!  It's called crispy, and Stacy's chips have crispness in abundance.  You open the bag and the delicate scent of cinnamon and of baked goods, exactly as if you had just opened the door to your favorite bakery. Breathe deep -- this is your bag of chips, and why not enjoy it?  Look in the bag and see those golden brown triangles of crisp-baked pita, generously covered with good cinnamon and sugar.  Offer a chip to the other people in the room, after all you have to be polite.  Be secretly glad that no one here knows how good they are, so you won't have to share - this time.<br /><br />Now you can take one of those perfect triangles and either bite it daintily or just pop it in your mouth. (Here's where it gets a little hazy)  You're going to have a few minutes of incredible flavor and texture, just like Mama used to make, if she made ""crust cookies,"" pie crust generously sprinkled with Cinnamon and Sugar, and baked to a flaky crispness. Take another bite and enjoy.  Let all those memories drift over you...<br /><br />And then you have an empty bag!  how could that be?  I had a full bag not two minutes before.  It must be some kind of universal time warp that occurs whenever I have a bag of Stacy's Chips.  I open the bag, lift a chip to my mouth and suddenly, the bag is empty, I want more, although I fear that eating three or more bags of these snacks a day would leave me the size of the Hindenburg.  Ah well, tomorrow is another day.  Hmmm - I may have gotten by that ""one-a-day"" rule.  Eat your normal bag of chips in the afternoon, then wait until after dinner.  Grab a bag of chips when you sit down with the family after dinner.  If anyone notices or says anything, say ""I wanted to have a bag with lunch, but I (forgot to grab them, the Quickie-mart was out, whatever excuse suits your fancy)<br /><br />Devour your second bag, and say that you want to watch a little bit of late night television after everyone else has retired for the night.  See all the misery and tragedy that news people love to send over the airwaves to keep you from having sweet dreams.  Now you have to do something to take your mind off the problems of the world. How about a little (tiny, really) bag of wonderfulness?  yep, it's after midnight, a new day, and time for your first bag of Stacy's to lull you off to sleep.  Best of all, no one knows about it!<br /><br />All of this is dependent upon Amazon and their wonderful delivery program which delivers these amazing treats at a very reasonable price.  Here in my area, the price that Amazon asks is less than half the cost at the Supermarket!  I can eat twice as many for the same price!  Whoo-Hoo!<br /><br />All kidding aside, these are wholesome, tasty snacks that aren't fried and can add a real punch of flavor to a low calorie diet.  They are delicious, economical and have none of the grease that you feel and taste in fried chips. Amazon sells them for a terrific price, and they arrive at your home amazingly fresh and without one broken chip.

In the process of having three surgeries, chemo and radiation treatments I, of course, lost my taste buds and couldn't find anything that really tasted good to me.  Having lost thirty pounds that I couldn't afford to lose, I desperately searched for something that tasted good to me.  Then I discovered Stacy's Cinnamon Sugar Baked Pita Chips!  How delicious they are!!!!<br /><br />I have gained ten pounds and could eat three bags of these chips per day except I can't afford them.  No only are they hard to find at stores in the Charlotte, NC area, they are really expensive.  Harris Teeter grocery stores stock them but they charge $3.49 per bag and Bi-Lo grocery stores charge $3.99 per bag.  With so few chips in a large bag, that is really too high.<br /><br />My last order for Stacy's Cinnamon Sugar chips through Amazon was for 24 of the small bags which really doesn't last me long.  By the time I add in shipping and handling for my order, I really don't save any money.  Being retired with a fixed income and incurring so many recent medical bills, I find it hard to afford to buy the chips.<br /><br />My recommendation to Stacy's Pita Chips Company would be to add more chips to the bag and also lower the retail price.  It would be great to have the chips available in discound stores, such as Wal-Mart, etc., in order to purchase them at a cheaper price.<br /><br />Stacy's should give me a free year's supply of the Cinnamon Sugar chips because I have told other cancer patients, a lot of friends and family about the chips and seem to have everybody ""hooked"" on them."

Friedman ""Schoolmarm""",0,0,3,1311811200,Could be Better,"It's delightful to see so many mainstream companies trying to improve the nutritional value of their products.  With this Veggie Pasta Macaroni and Cheese, Kraft has made a nice attempt in that direction with a product that has a very high kid-favored status.<br /><br />The veggies in question are in the pasta itself, which is made of a combination of grain and cauliflower.  It is tasty, indistinguishable from the standard wheat pasta product, and cooks up nicely al dente.  I truly enjoyed it and hope to find more of this pasta (alone) on the shelves.  It is far less tough than the more common tomato and spinach pastas.<br /><br />But that's where the goodness pauses while the powdered cheese sauce mix--still the original formula as far as I could tell--jumps in and loads the meal with sodium.  According to the package, it delivers a whopping 550 mg (23% of the adult daily requirement for someone on a 2000 calorie diet).  That jumps higher (28%) if the product is prepared with the added butter or margarine (I used an olive oil-based spread for just a bit of additional nutrition) and 2% reduced-fat milk (I used 1%, which did not affect the quality of the cheese sauce at all).  The calorie-count is still good at 370 for a full serving, which is half the box and about right for an adult if a salad or some other vegetable is served alongside.  I also added canned water-packed tuna to fill it out a bit so two adults would be satisfied.<br /><br />I'm sure Kraft could lower the sodium content without making the meal less palatable to the children it's really aimed at feeding.  If they do that, then this will become an excellent addition to the pantry shelf.  There's no denying that the flavor is great and the texture is exactly right, with the cheese sauce remaining slightly liquid without turning pasty as it sits on the plate.  Overall, it's a good start, and it certainly would be an improvement in the diets of families used to the regular Mac-and-Cheese products."

Nutrition content per serving is nearly identical (as boxed), and as prepared they tell you to use half as much margarine in the vegi mac and cheese vs the normal, so don't compare the ""as prepared"" nutrition content as you can easily cut the butter down with the normal and still retain great taste.  The normal box is 3 servings with 4T butter, this box is 2 servings with 2T butter, so cut the normal down to 3T and you should be fairly similar.<br /><br />Taste wise I notice very little difference between the two, this veggie mac might have a slight vegi aftertaste, but nothing too offensive.  If the price per serving were closer together I would recommend this mac and cheese.  The difference in taste is nothing as strong as whole wheat vs white flour breads.<br /><br />The bottom line is this doesn't really have any significant quantity of vegetables in it, the first ingredient is enriched cauliflower pasta product, but what this means is that it is enriched wheat flour with some dried cauliflower mixed in."

Both approaches are valid.<br /><br />The cheddar cheese powder tastes great as always, and the new veggie noodles taste the same but smell slightly off.  The box helpfully informs you on the back that one serving of this stuff provides 1/10th of your recommended daily helping of veggies, but uses up 1/4th of your allowance of saturated fat and sodium and about 1/5th of your allowance of calories.  Actually, it doesn't tell you that in so many words, but that's what you'll find if you read between the lines.  Delicious yes, health food no.<br /><br />In the end this is just a gimmick product to charge more for.  For some reason the price of Kraft 50% Whole Wheat Mac and Cheese remains about double the price of regular Mac and Cheese, and it looks like Veggie Pasta will hold to that strategy too.<br /><br />My advice: stock up on regular old Kraft Mac and Cheese when it goes on sale, toss out the noodles and use the cheddar powder with store-brand 100% whole grain macaroni noodles.

It's great that kids (and adults) are getting ""extra"" vegetables, but I've got a few questions:<br /><br />* How exactly are these vegetables incorporated into the Mac & Cheese?  Are they powdered?

The traditional Kraft macaroni is forgiving as far as cooking times - I have overcooked and undercooked the macaroni over the years with acceptable results.  However, though I followed the cooking time guidelines and tasted the noodles frequently, the overall texture was somewhat mushy compared to the traditional recipe.<br /><br />In order to get a whole serving of vegetables, one would have to eat the whole box of mac and cheese (which is something I have certainly done).  Clearly this product is not satisfy the ""Strive for 5 fruits and vegetables a day"" criteria for healthy eating, but I suppose that it is better than nothing.

I'm not convinced that including some dried cauliflower in the pasta really makes it a healthy option.<br /><br />Actually, cauliflower goes very well with Macaroni and Cheese.  Try adding a few florets into the macaroni when you boil it.

Don't worry if you dislike cauliflower- this tastes the same as standard Mac and Cheese pasta.  You do cook it for a minute less than the regular product.<br /><br />While you may be interested in buying this in order to get the vegetable serving, keep in mind you are paying about the same price for a smaller box (5.5 oz vs 7.25 oz).  The silver lining in this is that the calories in an entire prepared box are much lower in this veggie version (750 vs 1200 calories).<br /><br />This product may be useful for sneaking veggies into a kid's diet.

It smells like cauliflower when boiling.  It has a very mild cauliflower taste.<br /><br />In exchange for a slightly unusual taste, the ""veggie"" version of Kraft gives you:<br />Vitamin C 15% daily value (vs. 1% in the regular version)<br />Dietary Fiber 3 grams (vs. 1.5 in the regular stuff)<br /><br />Those were the only notable differences.  An extra 1.5 grams of fiber doesn't seem like a lot, but that's 12% DV instead of 6%.  For other nutrients, such differences matter a lot less.  The veggie version has 1 gram less fat, but that's only 11 calories worth of fat shaved from a food which is already fairly low in fat, and the total calories end up being the same anyway.  There are some 1% differences in some other vitamins, which doesn't matter.<br /><br />Getting back to the taste...<br />Even though there is only a small cauliflower influence on the taste, I found that it somehow did detract from enjoyment.  Blue-box Mac&Cheese has a very mild cheese flavor, which works OK when the noodles are normal.  But the very slight added cauliflower taste kind of masks the cheese.<br /><br />If you have kids demanding it 3 times per week, a little extra fiber and vitamin C might be a good idea.  But if this is your guilty pleasure food or just a backup plan for rare occasions, I would stick with the normal stuff.<br /><br />If you want to experiment with healthier noodles, there are several brands of dry pasta with omega 3 fats and added fiber.  They do tend to have a wheaty flavor, but on the other hand they don't have that weird cauliflower taste."

I was a bit hesitant, but fired up the stove, set the pot a-boiling and made the pasta -- the kitchen smelled mildly and pleasantly like Cauliflower. ADd the cheese, milk (in my case unsweetend Soy Milk) butter (in my case olive oil), mixed everyhing as per instructions,and -- well..<br /><br />I suppose this serves two or three people, but I ate the WHOLE pot in two closely spaced sittings. Ummm! It was creamy and WONDERFUL!! The cauliflower gave the pasta a tangy-sweet taste. On the second sitting (which took place about 5 minutes after the first sitting) I added Little Baby Peas to the mix, because I LOVE to add Little Baby Peas to my Mac and Cheese -- and then I scarfed it all up.<br /><br />This is a wonderful new product -- I would also suggest that Kraft consider another version, using carrots -- orange Mac and Cheese with Orange cheese -- and even -- Spinach maybe!<br /><br />I will buy this product again - it is really a great new twist on Kraft's ""usual"" (which I also love) Mac and Cheese."

Two of my other reservations involve the sodium level, and the stuff's ultimate nutritional void.<br /><br />So, enter Kraft Macaroni and Cheese Vegi Original. Using cauliflower in both the pasta and the sauce, Kraft has managed to accomplish the very same thing I'd been doing (sneaking in veggies), so I do feel better about this version. The bright orange color is there, so my son was happy, too. I hadn't told him I was trying anything new, but judging by the way he wolfed down his meal this tastes the exact same. Of course, that still leaves my sodium concern, and with 28% of the daily allowance in a prepared single serving, there's still quite a bit of salt in here.<br /><br />That said, my husband -- who does NOT like mac & cheese OR cauliflower -- also polished off his plate. In 14 years of marriage, I've never seen him do that.

Sure, it sneaks in some nutritional value, but face it--you can add regular veggies like broccoli or cauliflower to regular macaroni and cheese with far more cheese flavor.  This didn't deliver Kraft's signature cheesy flavor or a significant amount of vegetables to the diet.<br /><br />My recommendation is to just stick to the regular mac & cheese products and have your veggies with it--it's going to be a lot better for you.  This wasn't a great dish, and far from a successful one.<br /><br />Economically speaking, it has fewer servings in the box to deliver that half serving of vegetables, and by the time that half serving is shrunk even further by eating less of the entire box...there's not enough vegetables to matter."

Shipping arrived without any issues, no damage to the cans. Cans are kinda hard to open, compared to some other brands.  I immediately noticed that the oil tasted inferior to the olive oil used in their premium versions (this version uses soybean oil).  The sardines were acceptable quality, certainly not on par with their premium line, but certainly not bad.  The tasteless oil didnt help.  Sardines were packed in tight.  I would give the Sardines 3 Stars, if not for the fact that you get a great deal: 24 cans!  So 4 stars..barely.  I would've paid a little more to get better quality sardines in better oil."

It seems that buying 24 cans in warehouse packaging should be a better deal than this is offering to us. In addition my last two shipments were a bit less fish and more oil than the first ones. For those reasons I have dropped my earlier rating of 5 to 3 stars.<br /><br />Incidentally, I never received a response from the company as to why the front of the can says 120gm and the box says 95gm.<br />========================<br /><br />In the words of that wonderful Tina Turner classic- ""Simply the Best.""<br /><br />These are excellent in almost every way. Only the can itself could be improved.  I will admit that the container can be quite a challenge.  While it pops open easily, peeling the top gets progressively more difficult as you proceed.  It is nearly impossible to remove the lid entirely- and truly impossible to do so without ejecting  a bit of the oil from the can.  According to the packaging and can imprints, the sardines are caught wild and canned in Morocco. I think the containers might be made from abandoned WW II German tanks.<br /><br />That said, it is well worth the struggle.  Every can of the original 24 was fully packed with 4 fairly large, tan in color sardines: skinless (there were perhaps three sardines in the 24  cans with the slightest trace of skin remaining) and absolutely no bone. The taste and texture are excellent.  I have never had any particular thrill from olive oil, so the fact that these are in soy oil (and filled to the brim) was no problem for me to say the least.  Lightly salted (for sardines). You will almost surely be consuming 100% of the can content.<br /><br />This might not be the first choice of the top-tier of gourmet consumers (I am not one), but I can not imagine any sardine lover, nor many non-lovers, not being extremely pleased with this product.<br /><br />This is truly a 5-star selection.<br /><br />Note that while the front of the box says: ""Net Wt. 4.25 OZ (120g)""<br />the Nutrition Facts on the back of the box show it as 95g  which is 3.35 OZ<br />===================<br />From the packaging:<br />Serving size 1 can (95g) Servings per container 1<br />Amount per serving: (% = % Daily Value)<br />Calories 220 Calories from Fat 130<br />Total Fat 14g (21%)<br /> Saturated Fat 3g (17%)<br /> Trans Fat 0g<br />Cholesterol 35mg (12%)<br />Sodium 360mg (15%)<br />Total Carbohydrate 0g<br />Protein 24g (48%)<br />Vitamin A 0%<br />Vitamin C 0%<br />Calcium 6%<br />Iron 10%<br />Contains 2g of Omega-3 Fatty Acids per serving<br />Ingredients: Sardines, Soy Bean Oil, Salt<br />=================="

I must say that the bag was a big sell for me, having 5 kids bags always come in handy. The bag is a lower quality bag, you would not want to stuff a bunch of heavy items and carry it around all day. It would be great for kids to put toys in, light items, etc. Anyway, I reviewed the desription and it sounded pretty exciting to be getting a ""grab bag"" of K-cups essentially. I ordered it with Prime, got within 2 days and started digging. I was a tad dissapointed that is was very Green Mountain brand heavy. I love Green Mountain, but felt that I would get a little more brand variety. I am giving it a 4 star due to that fact. Other than that, there was a ton of different flavors, some bold, some flavored, and some nice classics! The other brands included were Donut House and Revv.<br /><br />Included were:<br /><br />34 Green Mountain brand varities<br />6 Donut House<br />4 Revv<br /><br />36+6+4= 44 so I got a bonus!!!!"

They also thought it was cute that it literally came in a red sack, though in packaging, the coffee is packed separately in a protective plastic. This item shipped quickly, was undamaged, and was thoroughly enjoyed by the recipients. If you're looking for a nice variety pack for yourself or as a gift, I would definitely recommend this."

So far, out of the flavored kinds, I'm digging the Southern Pecan and the Cinnamon Roll the best.  The Donut House non-flavored type is good too, and, my sampler didn't have a bunch of decaf, I think maybe one or two at most, which is fine, I need my caffeine in my K-cup fix!"

The box was in decent shape, but my bag looked like someone had stepped on it before it went into the box. Treads of some type on the bag.

Had to toss an awful lot of cups.<br /><br />There was a variety in the bag, though half the bag was decaf. A couple flavored coffees reg caff, and then a lot of different unflavored bold mixes.

They could do another set decaf instead, you would think.<br /><br />Overall, I would not been overjoyed, but at least have been content about the item if mine hadn't been badly mishandled, and sent to me anyway.

The color is a yellow, maybe a copper tone---nothing like gold. I used part of this for an anniversary cake--I had to drive to the arts and crafts store to purchase Wiltons Gold shimmer to attempt to cover this disaster. I thought $15 was pretty expensive in the first place, but after using the product I am sure it is not worth a single cent. I cannot believe how grotesque this color is. If I wanted a copper/yellow tone I would have just used edible dye---I sure would have saved the money for something else. I bake hundreds of cakes each year, and I am confident to say that this is the worst item I have ever used. Garbage.

566629,B008ADQY68,A3OGYXV9S7MJHM,Rita Lonie,0,0,4,1342915200,If you like...,"So I have a confession to make. I don't like pina coladas...or getting caught in the rain, for that matter. They're too sickeningly sweet filled with tropical flavors built to give me heartburn. I love fresh pineapple, but when I wasn't on meds to help fight my acid reflux, even looking at one was enough to send me into heartburn agony for a few hours. But now I can indulge and it's wonderful! Anyway, yes, I don't like pina coladas because of the creaminess as well, so I'm glad they released a pineapple matcha as well as a pina colada matcha. Pineapple I can definitely get behind. We love pineapple in this house, my wife spent some time in Mexico and fell in love with them there. We even have one of those pineapple corer/slicers, a big piece of $10 equipment with a single purpose that I refuse to live without.  I am very excited to be trying this matcha and I'm praying it will help feed in to that pineapple addiction we've found ourselves with. Maybe I'll try it swirled together with some strawberry matcha...I love the taste of pineapples and strawberries together.  Or any of the berries, for that matter. They just balance each other out so beautifully.<br /><br />So after a bit of mental back and forth, I decided to give this one a go. Pineapple can be done well in teas, so hopefully this one will live up to expectations. When I first mixed it up, my wife could smell it from across the room. ""That has to be bubble gum or cotton candy."" Nope, just pineapple! It does smell very sweet. At first sip, I'd be hard-pressed to find pineapple specifically, more of an overall tropical candy flavor with a touch of a medicinal aftertaste, like chewable baby aspirin. But in the aftertaste, the taste that lingers on your tongue, I found pineapple. Yum, yum, yum pineapple. I'm not too sure of this one, I'm going to have to try it with strawberry, but it's got all of the sweetness of pineapple and none of the tartness that makes it so good. I don't think this is one I'll be stocking up on, but I don't think I'll be forcing it on my friends either. I won't have any trouble finishing it, but I doubt I'll get more. Still, I am grateful to have been granted the chance to try it! I just don't think I'm enough of a tropical fruit fan to fully enjoy it."
566630,B001EQ4J1K,A1SB9BNNGKNX2Z,Jim,14,16,5,1235692800,Great stuff!,"My daughter often had a Carnation Instant Breakfast (CIB) for breakfast when she was in high school, leading my wife and I to give her grief for not having a good breakfast.<br /><br />Years later, when my aging father was ill and it was difficult to get him to eat as doctors said he should, a nurse recommended CIB, saying that it was a complete meal. Fortunately, my father loved it.<br /><br />Since then at least two other nurses have mentioned it to me, and for the past several years I've been drinking it fairly regularly. Now, it's rare that a day goes by when I don't have CIB for one of my meals.<br /><br />A major ice storm hit the rural area I live in recently, knocking out power, telephone, and even cellular service and water. Part of a tree in our front yard landed on the power line, and limbs of two tall trees fell onto our driveway, blocking our means of exit.<br /><br />Fortunately we had a fresh box of CIB on hand (French Vanilla, our favorite flavor) and a gallon of milk (which we kept ""refrigerated"" by keeping it in a cooler outside where the temps were below freezing). After that experience I realized that having a supply of CIB plus some powdered milk and bottled water on hand was as important as having flashlights, a portable radio, batteries, candles, and matches, etc., in case of emergency.<br /><br />I'm a big guy who likes to eat and who does a fair amount of physical labor, and a glass of CIB fills me up, gives me an energy boost, and keeps me satisfied till lunchtime (assuming I've had it in the morning; sometimes I have it for lunch instead).<br /><br />When I travel by car to visit relatives out of state I carry a supply of CIB with me. They may offer me eggs and sausage or bacon, etc., for breakfast, but if I have my CIB and milk is available, that and a good cup of coffee are all I need. I've also gotten into the habit of carrying a thermos with a pre-mixed CIB drink in it when I go on such road trips, so that I can have that for a meal when I'm on the road instead of having a McDonald's meal. I have noticed that I stay more awake and alert throughout the 8 1/2 hour drive if I substitute a CIB for a McMeal, and don't feel a need to pull into a rest area for a nap as I usually do after eating a McMeal.<br /><br />I swear by it and even though Amazon's price is only a few cents below what my local WalMart charges, getting CIB delivered to the door 3 boxes at a time is convenient and seems a good way to avoid ever getting low on it.<br /><br />I like it blended with a banana too, and in hot weather blending CIB with a banana and a scoop of vanilla ice cream makes for an extra special treat.<br /><br />I have apologized to my daughter for giving her a hard time about her CIB breakfasts when she was in high school. When I tell her that at least 3 nurses have raved about CIB to me, she says, ""See? SEE? And you and mom gave me such a hard time, telling me it wasn't enough to have for breakfast! Grrrr!!"" ;-)"

The biggest secret with this tea once given to Earl Grey of Hoswick Hall (British Prime Minister in 1830 - 1834) by a Chinese manadarin, reportedly in gratitude after the earl saved his life, is to get just the right doseage of bergamot oil, a rather intense, tangy scent derived from the bergamot orange (which in turn is a cross between the pear lemon and the sour orange; the latter is native to South Vietnam, and its oil was probably the recipe's original ingredient). Using too much bergamot oil can easily obscure the black tea's natural flavor - but with Twinings you just can't go wrong, because the original Earl Grey turned to this very company for a match to the quickly dwindling supply he had received from his Chinese friend.<br /><br />(From the Twinings website: ""When the mandarin's tasty gift began to run out, Earl Grey asked his tea merchants, Twinings, to match it for him. Twinings unique blend was the Grey family's long-standing favourite. When guests inquired about it, they were directed to Twinings on the Strand, where they would ask for Earl Grey's tea by name."")<br /><br />Unless you insist on having *all* your tea with cream or milk, I recommend having this one without any kind of milk products: not only does the original recipe not call for such an addition; in my mind it just plain ruins the blend's particular flavor. (But that's just me, of course.) Whichever way you have it, though, if scented teas are your kind of thing, Twinings Earl Grey should be right up your alley."

If you like your tea a little less potent, you can either let it steep a shorter period of time or use less tea thereby making the tin of tea leaves produce more cups of tea.<br /><br />You also get the tea packaged in a tight fitting tin rather than a cardboard box so that the tea will stay fresh longer.

I was shocked. This smelled almost exactly like when I make coconut curry sauce on my own. It smelled so fresh and authentic, the only thing left to doubt was the taste. Surely the aroma was just some canned, chemically manufactured olfactory trick. I was happily proven wrong. The taste and the smell all fit together. And unlike Campbell's canned soups, where you had small pieces of of mushy vegetables or meat, here you had big pieces of carrots and chicken and crunchy water chestnuts, the shittake mushrooms were small however, but not negligible.<br /><br />Seriously try it out for yourself.

The litter is composed of smooth, compressed and extruded pine sawdust pellets, shaped like miniature broken dowel rods. The sawdust is a by-product of the lumber industry, which must be convenient for the Florida company that produces Feline Pine, because pine trees grow like weeds in the South.<br /><br />I tried a bag to replace the ordinary silica clay cat litter we had been using for our little cat. It is not quite as absorbent or as fast-drying as clay litter; however, there is far, far less tracking and the sharp odor of ammonia is much less than that with the clay litter. Any ""dust"" that the pine pellets might have is not at all noticeable, and my little cat adjusted to using it without a problem.<br /><br />As the pellets absorb moisture, they swell and disintegrate into fine, soft sawdust. I suspect my little cat prefers the smooth texture of the pellets and the softness of the sawdust to the old small, hard, sharp clay gravel that got stuck in her paws. The sawdust does not dry as quickly as clay litter, even with daily ""stirring"", but the woodsy, evergreen fragrance of pine makes scooping much less of a chore.<br /><br />The only drawback to this litter is that the pellets are a bigger than clay litter gravel, requiring a wide-slot scooping tool so you don't dump a clump of pellets into the toilet when you scoop solid waste. The bag is attractive and resealable plastic, but I think paper packaging with a clear window to see the product would entice cat owners to switch. The packaging also says ""CHEMICAL FREE..."" which is false; our planet is composed of chemicals. H2O (water) is a chemical. It should read ""HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL FREE"" or ""BIOTOXIN FREE"".<br /><br />Anyway, I'll be using the old clay litter only to clean up the oil stains in my carport. Now that I've tried a premium litter, I'll experiment with the wheat and corn types to find which one my little cat likes best."

My cat used to use the compressed, recycled newsprint litter (like Carefresh or Yesterday's News) and I thought that was good, but then I read about Feline Pine and decided to give it a try. Well, there is simply NO SMELL AT ALL. I live in a small studio apartment which I thought was forever fated to smell like a litterbox, but with the discovery of Feline Pine, which absorbs all of the ammonia  odor, you don't even know I have a cat unless you see her. The tracking is noticably reduced and there is much less mess. I highly recommend you try this stuff - my cat made the switch with no problem at all, and it's been completely worth it for both of us (my apartment doesn't stink, and she doesn't inhale clay dust.)"

I could just hear her nagging voice:  Clean up that damn litter box!  I got a little scared every now and then.<br /><br />Then one day she heard about Feline Pine.  The pellets were little strange for me to get used to, but I was willing to do anything to keep the mean lady happy.  Then, I couldn't believe my whiskers.  There was no smell for weeks.  The pellets started turning to sawdust.  And there was no smell, same litter for two weeks or more!

However, we had some usage in the first and once we converted the second to fp they seemed to be perfectly happy. Results have been great! there is more odor immediately after the cat goes #2 but there is literally no on-going odor and the cats don't smell like chemicals after using the litter box. Much better for us and them. In addition, there is far less tracking (we use the non-clumping fp). Once the cat urine has broken the pellets into sawdust you can see some tracking of the sawdust but that is an easy indicator it is time to do some cleaning! Definitely need to have the right equipment (sifting cat litter box and the right scooper). Very happy customer."

DO NOT buy the Van Ness sifting box, the holes are too big.<br /><br />2)Scoop solids daily with a pellet-specific scoop like the one that comes with the Breeze.<br /><br />3) Sift urine soaked sawdust to the bottom compartment by either shaking the box side to side or scooping the pellets around until the all the sawdust falls through to the bottom. I go with the latter because I don't feel like lifting it.<br /><br />4) Enjoy the rest of your day not worrying about the litter box.<br /><br />Remember to empty out the compartment with the sawdust every few days. I have 1 cat, so you may have to do it more often if you have multiple cats. I also keep the Breeze urine pads as lining in the lower part in case any urine trickles down and to absorb the smell of the sawdust."

I need heat and the only products that give me any detectable heat, are specialty sauces like Dave's insanity or ghost pepper sauce.  I had bought the Insanity in the past and was looking for it when I found a discounted price on the ghost pepper.  For the past 10 days I have been using it on everything.  I supplement bbq sauces with it, blend it with salsas, even mix it with yellow mustard on egg, sausage, and cheese bagels.  My tolerance is growing.  I went from a dab to about 1/2 tsp already.  This allows me to enjoy the smoky, sweet flavor (at first all you feel is the heat).  I don't think that this is as hot as Insanity but it's been awhile and the internet searches all say that the ghost pepper is much hotter.  Maybe I am just advancing along my heat journey, but this doesn't seem to burn my skin/lips/mucous membrane as much as insanity sauce did.  I will be stocking up on more bottles of this sauce.  I put it on a drop at a time and then spread it with a knife.  I have found that it works best with a medium like BBQ, salsa, mustard.  You should put those on first since they are the vehicle to allow this to be spread evenly.  Otherwise the bread, tortilla, etc just soaks up the drops and you have uneven distribution."

Habaneros are hot; we grew some habaneros in our garden this past year. As you parse them into dishes in a sensible manner, you get heat and they also support flavor.<br /><br />I just got this product a week ago. I immediately used it with a pasta dish served at my place of employment. Two drops with the pasta--stirred so that the pepper sauce was spread evenly throughout the dish.<br /><br />Oh, boy! A nice heat. After finishing my dish, there was a light burn on my lips and at the back of my mouth. The sauce did not obscure the taste of the dish, but actually added an additional element. In addition, my forehead was moist from perspiration and my nose started running. But a small price to pay!<br /><br />This is a fine addition to my kitchen.

Habanero and above is a requirement to eat at our table. So with that in mind, pay no attention to those who say that they are using this as rodent repellent and other rediculous applications. This hot sauce is hot but not unbearable. It is flavorful and goes well in many of our dishes. I put some on our holiday turkey and was impressed by the way it interacts. Now, for those that think you have to splash hot sauce on everything, you really are just wasting product. A spread over a wide surface with just enough sauce to colorize the surface is perfect. We are comparing this sauce to the Dave's Insanity sauce which is slightly less heat at the beginning but Insanity burns longer with more intensity than this one does. This one trails off after a few minutes but doesnt have the intensity at the beginning. Overall, we definitly like them both and I am going to go ahead and purchase Ultimate Insanity today to fill out the offerings at our table. Great product!"

Someone had brought some in to work and it was being passed around. I love hot food, so I figured I might as well try it. I have not explored any exotic peppers or sauces - just the usual jalapeno, habanero, cayenne, and other ordinary peppers. I'm no expert and would never claim to be, just to be clear. My initial impression of this sauce was ""yuck"" because it was so bitter and metallic and unpleasant to me. It is hot, yes, but not OMG-I'm-dying hot.

This was actually the second one from package and I love it. Third one was ""West African VooDoo Juice"" that actually comes with handmade voodoo doll :), but besides that makes a great and original addition to your food and therefore deserves recommendation.

I was unimpressed with their habanero ""hot"" salsa. Eager to kick it up a notch, I reached for a bottle of what I later found to be Dave's Gourmet Ghost Pepper Jolokia Hot Sauce. I unscrewed the top and went to put a dab on. I quickly realized that there was no flow regulation but not before a large pool of the magma colored liquid dripped into my lunch. I decided to dab my finger in it and see what I was dealing with. It was formidable, sweet and flavorful with a long heat. I thought I could take the heat.<br /><br />I demolished the burrito, hot sauce and all, and shrugged off the pain. Every bite was saturated with the taste of a thousand tortured souls but the guacamole still tasted great. I wiped my tingling lips and while downing a glass of water I looked at the bottle. It claimed a heat rating of ""Insanity++."" I headed home thinking surely the worst must be over. I've ate plenty of hot food and my stomach is battle tested. I was wrong.<br /><br />I walked no more than a block before I started to feel odd. It was in the forties in Cleveland but I could feel the sweat forming on my brow. I walked another block and I could literally feel the burning sensation outlining my stomach. My breaths were noticeably faster and shorter. People on the street looked at me weird. I figured it would go away by the time I got home but I decided to pick up the pace. By the time my apartment was in sight I was experiencing tunnel vision and it felt like a live agitated weasel had been placed inside me. I knew what I had to do. After flushing my lunch, a tablespoon of this sauce, half a gallon of milk, and my ego down the drain, I can honestly say I am just happy to be alive. This sauce is not for mortals."

Initially, it was hot but certainly no hotter than other sauces I've had.  I quickly followed up with another dime sized dab on a chip.  Shortly thereafter, it began to feel as if my tongue was being electrocuted.  My eyes began to sting and my lips went numb.  The ecstasy brought about by eating spicy food poured up out of my mouth and into my head.  I laid down and the dog started to act very worried.  While prostrate, I focused on the pain and stared into the darkness of my own eyelids.  Every little thing becomes significant when the mind is seeking relief from pain.  I do not know what will happen when this stuff makes its way through my digestive tract.  I'll be eating more soon."
566782,B001PQTYN2,A17HMM1M7T9PJ1,Timothy B. Riley,32,34,4,1234742400,The Hottest of the Hot (for now),"It seems like there is a new ""Hottest Pepper in the World"" every couple of years or so.  Not too long ago it was the Red Savina® Habanero with a Scoville heat rating of 577,000 units.  Now it is the Naga Jolokia (also known as the Naga Morris, Nai Miris, Bih Jolokia and Bhut Jolokia, etc.) with a whopping 1,001,304  Scoville Heat Units according to the New Mexico State University Chile Pepper Institute. In February 2007, Guinness World Records certified the Bhut Jolokia (aka Naga Jolokia) as the hottest pepper in the world.  It is reportedly called the ""Ghost Pepper"" because after one bite of the pepper you ""give up the ghost"".<br /><br />Now Dave's Gourmet has made a sauce from this serious pepper.  This is nothing to fool around with, it will cause pain, a lot of pain.  So why would anybody want a sauce that hot (other than for bravado)?  I for one like the taste.  It is a little smokier that Habanero.  I also use it in sauces where I want heat but not the red color of chili peppers, such as a cream based sauce.  Since it only takes a drop to give me the heat that I want it will hardly change the color of a white sauce.<br /><br />My only reservations about it is that it contains hot pepper extract (which is what they call the stuff that they spray in the eyes of criminals).  I've seen hot pepper extract for sale as a commercial additive.  It's low on flavor but big on heat.  Was this added to give the sauce extra pain inducing heat while using fewer actual Jolokia peppers? I don't know but it makes you think.  Dave also has a special edition sauce that uses the Bhut Jolokia pepper and cost about four times more than this one does.  I like this sauce, but use with caution."

After receiving this industrial solvent in the mail, I called some buddies over for burritos, beer and baseball.<br /><br />Cut to fifteen minutes later: four men are sitting around, watching baseball and drinking beer as it dawns on them that there is an angry dragon writhing about in each of their stomachs.  The dragons breathe white hot fire that scorches their mouths and ravages their tongues.  Ever men, they remain erect and try to soothe the dragon's temper with gifts of alcohol. Quickly, though, the supply dwindles and furtive glances dart around the room.  Who will break first?  As sweat drips down their foreheads and stings their eyes, they try to think about baseball...think about baseball...think about baseball...and then one makes a break for it!  In an instant there is a stampede for the kitchen.  They fling open the refrigerator and, snorting like wild bulls, rip open another case and chug like Dionysus reborn--but to no avail.<br /><br />This alcohol is fueling the fire and not dousing it.  With choked and gasping breath one whispers ""milk"".  Upending the kitchen they can find none of the sweet elixir.  With tears streaming down their faces they tear outside, but in the rush of flailing limbs they fall into a heap on the pavement.  ""Oh no"" they say, realizing the horrible truth.  In their haste to quench this insatiable heat they made a fatal mistake: they are way too drunk to drive.  Rising from the ground, they take off on foot for the nearest corner store.  Soon, none can bear to breathe through their mouths; the dragon's flames lick at their lips unbearably.  As they breathe heavily through their noses, their sinuses are soon aflame from the intense heat and begin their own form of self defense.<br /><br />What a spectacle!  Four grown men with red faces, streaming eyes and snot flying into the wind as they gasp and wheeze down the road, driven by the fires of hell itself.<br /><br />Soon, the fat one falls, hitting the ground hard but stretching his hands out for help.  Through the sneezing and wheezing no words can escape his ruined lips.  Onward the three friends push with nary a backward glance.  ""We will remember you fondly, fat one"" they say to themselves, hearts roasted free of compassion.<br /><br />They burst into the corner store as one drunken, moaning entity of pure thirst and claw their way to the milk.  With wild abandon, they forego such modern niceties as payment and immediately pour gallons of soothing white mana into their gaping, flaming maws.  They sink to the floor in the silent thanks of men spared the gallows.  One thought lingers in their minds: ""that guac sure was tasty."""

Standard shape, somewhat mundane label, but it contained a substance that had a curiously bright crimson and orange color. Once opened it had a spicy smell, not unlike Tobasco although thankfully without the overwhelmingly foul essence of vinegar.<br /><br />Well, time for a taste. I got a good thick coat of the bright substance on my index finger and took the plunge. It had a pretty nice tangy flavor... That is it had a nice flavor for about 1500 milliseconds before Oppenheimer hit the red button and, ""I am become heat, the destroyer of digestive tracts.""<br /><br />The heat hit me like a runaway freight train hitting a house of cards. No, make that a run away freight train with several JATOs attached to the rear propelling it somewhere above the upper class neighborhood of mach 2. I doubled over and let out a raspy gasp, my face flushed to a hue not unlike the sauce itself, my eyes became a water park. My aural senses became dull like I was at the bottom of a swimming pool.<br /><br />I heard a knock at the door and stumbled towards it with blurred vision. It was a county sheriff at the door and he was there to serve me. My own tongue, esophagus, uvula, stomach, and intestinal tract had somehow just filed a class action lawsuit against me. I reeled backwards and fell onto the couch and tried to focus my bleary eyes on a small fuzzy object on the floor. It was my cat, standing quietly and observing my plight. Maybe it was the impaired vision, maybe it was the start of something more spiritual, but my cat's face warped into a Cheshire smile many times the girth of his face. Each tooth glowing with the luster of tarnished gold in an unholy candlelight. His eyes sank back into ashen voids, glimmering ember pin points at the center of each gaping socket. The room around him began to dance and spin and the walls eventually melted away to reveal a brimstone canyon stretching as far as could be imagined. ""Soooo hoooot it's spoooooky,"" my cat boomed, his voice echoed with a baritone bass that would surely send James Earl Jones running for the hills. Sweating, hyperventilating, and nearly blind, my vision finally faded to black.<br /><br />I awoke with blinding light bombarding my face. How long was I out? Slowly gyrating figures came into focus and as my eyes adjusted more I recognized them as people standing over me. A few more moments and I was able to see one of the faces and... Grandpa?!<br /><br />I bolted upright nearly headbutting the entire crowd looming over me ""Am I dead?!"" I shouted.<br /><br />""No, no. You just had a bit too much of the insanity sauce in one go, I'm afraid. You'll be back to the mortal world in a few moments,"" my grandpa stated non nonchalantly, adjusting his tie slightly.<br /><br />""So, wait,"" I began, ""Wha... what is this? ...Is this?""<br /><br />""Maybe,"" grandpa shrugged, ""Perhaps you can ask me again on your next visit in a day or two.""<br /><br />""Next visit?!"" I shouted, ""I'm not touching that sauce ever again! Except maybe per drop. Diluted in very large amounts of some sort of substrate like chilli. I-""<br /><br />Grandpa smiled and interrupted, ""You only have a few seconds left. You'll be back at least once more, I know that for sure.""<br /><br />""For sure?"" I asked genuinely confused.<br /><br />Grandpa tiled his head, looking at me like I had just grown a third eye, ""Well yeah. You already ate the stuff, and what goes in has to come out eventually.""<br /><br />My face cracked and was painted with the same look a deer must have in the headlights of an approaching freight train that is powered by several JATO motors. Before I could seek further council I was grasped firmly by an unknown force and suddenly yanked away. The light got sucked into darkness and the roar of passing wind deafened me. I was falling.<br /><br />Soon something came into focus, approaching fast. It was the ground, rushing to greet me with the eagerness of a freshman salesperson thinking they've identified an easy mark. I began screaming, as if that would help. My life didn't flash before my eyes, I didn't have any final profound thoughts, my whole head was filled with paralyzing unmitigated terror. Closer, closer, closer. The ground hurled itself towards me in excitement to say hello to my face with a big wet, red kiss. And just as I'm 1mm away from contact...<br /><br />I jerk upright on my couch, back in my house. Sweaty and tongue numb, cat still sitting on the floor looking as plain as can be. I breathe a heavy sigh of relief, although doing so has a noticeable heat to it due to the remnants of the sauce. I hold my head in my hands and try to regain composure, reassuring myself it was just some weird dream brought on by everyday stress combined with the sudden shock of the ghost pepper sauce. My eyes drift around coming to rest on a stack of papers on the coffee table. Legal papers? I'm... I'm suing myself?<br /><br />I've since been eating lots of cheese and chocolate hoping to stave off the inevitable second visit to Grandpa.<br /><br />This sauce is hot. Really hot. Use a drop at a time in large volumes of other stuff that needs a bit of heat.<br /><br />Pros: Ultra super mega hot. Nice bright, festive color - If HGTV did a makeover of Satan's house they'd probably paint the living room with this stuff for the color.<br />Cons: Flavor is made irrelevant due to the absurd level of heat. No stopper in the bottle's neck so be careful about pouring."

I am a lover of hot sauces and have heard about the nuclear qualities of the Ghost Pepper. I had heard that it needed 2 keys turned at the same time just to open the bottle.. The label claims it is a ""great industrial cleaner and grease remover"".. Bah, enough I said. I had made some Turkey chili previously and had some leftovers so what a great way to try this ""So hot it's spooky"" sauce. I put a tiny bit on my pinky and licked it off, immediately my lips,toungue and mouth were tingling. It tickled my fancy. After a few minutes I began to sweat and my face flushed a bit. Bah... No worries. My wife sampled a drop on the end of a toothpick and was burning up for almost an hour. I splashed a drop into my chili, stirred it and nothing. Felt no heat, dropped some more in.. stirred it and let it set, mmmm good heat... I went do put some more sauce in and a quarter sized glob ejaculated out. I stirred it, let it set and Holy Hell... What a difference. I instantly began sweating, my nose was dripping and my sinus cavity was conflagrated. I loved it. I ate more, it got worse. My hearing diminshed and my eyes were burning. I ate more chili, my esophagus burned. I kept on going, had some milk. I finished the bowl in about 20 mins. I felt like death. It hit my stomach and it felt like a WWF battle royal in there. I got dizzy, had to sit down.. I became soft spoken and started to burp a lot. The next 2 hours created so much bubbly gas that I farted about every 30 seconds, some so loud that it registered on the Richter scale. I felt better. I survived. I had to work the next day. I am a firefigher and am used to heat. I had to poop. I never felt more of a delightfully different burn coming out of me. I had 3 of these episodes in about an hour. Putting a roll of toilet paper in the freezer would have helped quell the fire. I laughed, the guys on my shift laughed.<br /><br /> All in all, it's really a great tasting sauce with a lot of heat.

It is obviously not made for just plopping on your food, more likely mixing in a large bowl of chili (or for pranking your friends). Although this stuff is RIDICULOUSLY hot, it actually has some taste compared to other sauces of similar potency. I has an interesting smokey flavor and tastes like straight-up jolokia. Doing the toothpick test with this is bearable, but the heat sneaks up on you about 2-3 minutes in and it lingers for eternity. Wherever you placed the toothpick will temporarily feel like you actually burned it there. Yeah, its hot!<br /><br />Please know what you are getting into if you buy this. It is a sauce with extract in it and is VERY hot. The especially sneaky part is that the temperature creeps up on you and takes a few minutes to really kick. This is not a sauce you would put directly on your food like tobasco or something. Be warned!"

Does Dave's Ghost Pepper Naga Jolokia Hot Sauce capture the taste of the pepper?<br /><br />I, for one, absolutely love the fruity, bright taste of the Habanero - yes, Habaneros are hot, but their taste is exquisite; capturing that taste, or complimenting it, in a hot sauce takes real skill. Now, to be honest, I'm not sure what the Bhut Jolokia tastes like in its raw state, as I have yet to have the opportunity to try it (though I am looking for just such an opportunity). I would assume this sauce does the job, considering the ingredient list:<br /><br /> * Naga Jolokia<br /> * hot pepper extract<br /> * salt<br /> * vegetable oil<br /> * roasted garlic pulp<br /> * acetic acid<br /><br />The thing that worried me is that second ingredient - ""hot pepper extract"" is, no doubt, capsaicin. I take issue with including it in this hot sauce, as it artificially raises the heat level. Why not allow the Bhut Jolokia stand on its own? Who cares if the resulting sauce doesn't melt my face off? ""The Source"" or the plethora of has-no-flavor-but-who-cares-because-its-insane-heat-impresses-people hot sauces can do that for me if I am looking for that kind of experience.<br /><br />Overall, this sauce has a decent flavor if you can get past the distracting quantity of heat. I suppose I should have expected the company that gave us ""Dave's Insanity Sauce"" to miss the mark, since heat seems to be their only goal; none of ""Dave's Gourment"" sauces has ever impressed me with flavor, I shouldn't fault them for merely being consistent. :)"

All I need is one drop into whatever it is I am eating or cooking, and I am done. With other hot sauces, I would go through an entire bottle in a week. What made me a fan of Dave's hot sauces, is the smoky flavor that still comes through despite the heat.<br /><br />My last bottle of Dave's original insanity sauce was running out, and I thought I'd give a different one a try. I decided on the Ghost Pepper hot sauce because it has good review and free shipping from Amazon. I received the shipment very fast, it almost feel like next day although I certainly did not pay for that option. I tried the hot sauce in a stew I made by just putting a couple of drops in my bowl. It's got good heat like the original, but I find the flavor lacking a little. It's got a different flavor that reminds me of a Louisiana style hot sauce, but not quite as tangy. It's just as hot, though I don't feel it's much hotter, than the original.<br /><br />I have to say that I was a little disappointed. I will by buying another bottle of the original Dave's insanity hot sauce."

There's a pretentious part of me that likes being able to experience new tastes, tastes that the average person wouldn't even notice due to their excruciating tongue agony.  If I don't enjoy those flavors, then the whole exercise is pointless.<br /><br />If you can handle it, this sauce *tastes good*, which is a rare treat among the ultra-hot sauces.  I would apply it liberally to many different dishes, if I didn't value my sanity so highly.<br /><br />The experience differs from other sauces.  With other hot foods (even mild ones like jalape&ntilde;os), it's a pretty straightforward battle: it's spicy, I ate it, and now it's burning my mouth.  Then there's this sauce (and other ghost pepper-based foods), which is a whole different thing... instead of it burning me, it feels like *I'm* the one burning and I just didn't notice it until now.  It's a fun twist.<br /><br />Word to the wise: this stuff builds up over time.  When the bottle first arrived, I put a tiny dot of it on a french fry just to check it out.  I tolerated that small amount with no problem, but it'll sneak up on you.  It started with a mild tingle, and built to a noticeable sting over the course of about five minutes.  If you forget this fact, you'll eat an enchilada with a bit of sauce on every bite and finish the meal feeling like a champ... only to be rendered speechless and near-catatonic ten minutes later.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this sauce to anyone who *isn't* just in it for the bragging rights.

If you're looking for something that tastes great on its own, you'd best look elsewhere. But if it's heat your after, you've chosen the right product.

That was merely good storytelling rather than a truthful review of this sauce. The sauce has a very pleasant fruity tasty but not from any additives but rather from the natural taste of the ghost chili the main ingredient (although it has an odd smell like sweaty socks). Its no where near as hot as Dave's original insanity sauce. I can eat it a drop or two at a time on a corn chip or in a taco and the burn is moderate to hot but not crazy hot, whereas Dave's original insanity sauce would make a whole pot of chili burn with just a drop or two.

I've noticed some of these reviews saying it tastes/smells nasty - I suspect a bad batch - because what I just had is really quite tasty. Its also very, very hot. I had a quarter sized dollop on a corn chip (after a couple smaller doses) - and its a really quite excellent 15 minutes burn - tears, sweat, red face and a nice endorphined finish. That being said, I've had raw habaneros that seemed hotter, and lasted longer (it's all pretty subjective). There were no hiccups, or that panicky feeling you sometimes get when you've had something ""way too hot"". It ramps up nicely, and crests at about 10 minutes; gone in 15. I suspect this stuff is some portion of the heat of a raw jolokia pepper, but not really on par with the real thing (hard to say since I've not yet had one). So, yeah, really great burn without being over the top. And its quite a nice hot sauce too - smoky and a little sweet. There may be hotter sauces out there, but this is just a good hot sauce, that happens to be face-meltingly hot, as well. In all actuality, as hot as ""edible"" gets - any hotter and you really wouldn't want it on a taco. Fun at parties, and highly recommended."

The review I got from the person I gave it to as a gift said it caused him to break into an all-over sweat, he teared up, had to stand over the sink with his mouth open for 20 minutes, and was late for work that morning.  This is someone who eats things with hot sauce added regularly and has never had a hot sauce win.  This one did.  Mission accomplished."

But it's hot for hot's sake: the sauce is really just a heat delivery system, without really bringing anything to the party in terms of flavor. It smells like it should have some of the smoky sweetness of a good jolokia sauce, but if you can actually pick up any distinctive flavors behind the wall of heat it generates in your mouth I'd be surprised.<br /><br />Second, the texture of this sauce is just off. I know Dave's sauces tend to be thicker than most, but this is practically a paste. The thickness causes two major problems. The sauce is difficult to dose out, tending to either catch in the bottle's neck or plop out in large dollops well beyond what any reasonable person would want. Also, it's hard to distribute across your food.<br /><br />Third, it's impractical. Something this hot and thick is far more useful as an ingredient than a condiment, but even when I'm making spicy food I seldom have need for anything this potent. I can't imagine using it on a slice of pizza or in scrambled eggs.<br /><br />Sauces like Holy Jolokia and Naga Soreass will let you experience the subtle flavors that come with the intense heat of the pepper. Dave's Ghost Pepper just gives the heat, without really showcasing the pepper itself.<br /><br />Get it for when you make large pots of chili or when you want to haze fraternity pledges. Otherwise, stick with thinner sauces that have some versatility."

Never mind the warning on the label marked ""Intense++"" or the fact it says the sauce doubles as an industrial degreaser! Onto my story, a co-worker had brought some of this colon cleaner into the office. I noticed a group of co-workers huddled around sticking toothpicks into a mysterious red bottle. Come to find out it is Dave's Ghost Pepper Naga Jolokia Hot Sauce. Being the connoisseur of spicy foods and sauces that I am, I couldn't help but chuckle inside at my co-workers. Using toothpicks to try hot sauce? Really? PANSIES! So I did the only logical thing, I had to show them up! I grabbed the bottle (before reading anything on the label), put a dime size drop on my hand, and promptly licked it off! The first few seconds were magical, Dave's sauce packs a wallop of flavors, however before I could even discern what flavors those were, my enjoyment quickly turned to ""Holy crap, that was a bad idea"". My tongue and lips were instantly on fire! Being use to many different spicy and fiery foods, I knew I would be ok, but since I was not expecting the tongue punching that I just received I was taken back. For the next 5 minutes or so my tongue was tingling and so was my poor lips, which by the way had an open wound from me biting down on it during dinner the night before. That's another story, but as you could imagine it did not help one bit! Anyways, this sauce is damn good and I immediately ordered some last night to add to my pantry. This is definitely a sauce that should be used in moderation and will be awesome mixed together with actual food or other condiments. Not recommended for solitary consumption."

I tried to pour just a drop onto a small plate of nachos, but more than I wanted came out - maybe a 1/2 teaspoon. I mixed it around and dug in; it was good, but packs some serious 5 alarm heat. It is sweetly smoky, but this lasts only for the initial few seconds before the blazing, unquenchable inferno from the pit of hell begins. My eyes watered. Sweat formed on my brow. My nose ran. Brutal... just brutal. Another friend poured this stuff on his burger like ketchup (dripping down the side), and ate it like it was nothing!

566802,B001PQTYN2,A1DCGCRUQJVEEH,Rob from SoCal,1,1,5,1343001600,My favorite so far!,"OK.  I grew up in a family that would pay me a $1 to eat a Jalapeno.  As such, it does not surprise me that many people find this sauce TOO hot.  I do not.  It is perfect thus far.  My experiences in different foods follow.<br /><br />First Taste : Drop on my finger : At first, great aroma and flavor.  Then, the heat started to build and hit max fairly quickly.  With other sauces I have found this means it will then die down, however Dave's Ghost Pepper sauce lingers.  The burn lasted a good long while (I would estimate 15-20 minutes, with pretty much a glass or 2 of water).<br /><br />Chicken Alfredo : Afraid that the drop on my tongue was unrepresentative and the heat would de-intensify with food, I put on 4 or 5 drops to a medium bowl of Chicken Alfredo. This was a tad too much.  It didn't kill me, but wow did I drink several glasses of water.<br /><br />Wendy's Chili : I loved this so much I picked up another bottle from a store nearby work that carried it and thought it would do well in Wendy's Chili (which is close by).  I put one drop first and tried.  Not quite enough.  I put another drop and it was perfect.  While Wendy's chili is certainly not the best, this hot sauce made it all that much better!<br /><br />Hamburger : I purchased a Jalapeno burger patty from Stater Bros (local food chain).  2 drops mixed with other condiments (Chipoltle Mayo and Jalepeno Mustard) was perfect.  It added the desired amount of heat and flavor (did I mention this sauce has a fantastic flavor!?!?)<br /><br />Chili Mac : Made with ground turkey.  Yep, this is a pretty low ball dish.  I meant to put 2 drops, but wound up with 1 drop and a dollop the equivalant of 3, so 4 total.  I'm not sure if I'm just building up resistance, but this was awesome.  It wasn't so hot as to have me sweating, but it was a definite (and enjoyable) battle to finish it!<br /><br />I have tried all of the ""usual suspects"" (Tapatio, Trader Joe's Jabanero (which also isn't bad)) in addition to Melinda's Ghost Pepper Sauce, and this is my favorite by far due to both heat and flavor.  Melinda's has a fantastic flavor, but leaves much to be desired in the heat department.<br /><br />Feel free to clue me in to great tasting hot (and hotter) sauces.  I have always been a fan of ""heat"", but now I am an addict (thanks to Dave's Ghost Pepper Hot Sauce!!!)."
566803,B001PQTYN2,A3A8S3C9FHPY3N,"Eric Marshall ""-Eric""",1,1,5,1331078400,New Favorite Sauce- Compared to Dave's original,"I like to think of the potent flavors found in Dave's line of sauces sort of like Stinky cheeses. Some people hate them, some people love them, and there is a lot of subjectivity so any review that regards the flavors or smells as good or bad must be taken with a grain of salt because it's all about personal preference. I'm not saying that Dave's sauces taste like foot cheese, just pointing out another ""food group"" that can pack some very pungent strong flavors and smells that some people find very repulsive. Dave sauces are thick with ingredient and not ""watered"" down or full of vinegar. They have a very strong smell and flavor that some people may not like. I think that like fancy cheeses, dark beers, or black coffee, powerful hot sauces like Dave's are an acquired taste that takes time to appreciate.<br /><br />I find the Ghost pepper version here to lean sweeter and smokier than the original dave's by quite a bit and like both very much but for different reasons. Heat level is very hard to compare amongst things unless they are orders of magnitude different. The Ghost bottle has one more ""+"" next to the ""insanity"" rating than the original but I find that heat level ""ratings"" within an already very hot group of sauces are not very important since it really all comes down to how much capsicum is ingested and how much comes into contact with the sensitive parts of the mouth/throat. The long term cost of desiring a spicy hit at nearly every meal is actually lower with sauces in this category because they do the trick in small doses. My limit is about a teaspoon on a meal and that makes for a very powerful endorphin response that leaves me rather incapacitated for about a half hour after meal time. Usually use less than that but everyone once and awhile pepper heads feel the need to push limits and cause some real pain. I  have noticed that different sauces (made from different peppers) have different heat ""behaviors."" Some are a hard hitting short duration burn in the mouth and on lips, and some you can feel as a warm buzzing through the torso for hours after eating them. The extract used in Dave's sauces seems to be a pretty good blend of both of those attributes, but I would say that the ghost pepper adds a more drawn out, building style heat that effects the ""whole body"" rather than just the mouth more-so than the Original Dave's Insanity Sauce.<br /><br />My bottle of Dave's Original Insanity was almost empty, so I picked this Ghost variant up at World Market as it would be a shame not to have another bottle of magma ready to go. I couldn't resist opening it right away and trying it out. The first experience with it left me wondering if I might have an allergy to it as it caused some sensations I had not felt with other sauces. The more I used it, the more I started to appreciate it's ""effects."" From my subjective point of view, it is the best flavor in any hot sauce I have ever had. I usually get bottles of various ""normal"" heat hot sauces (watered down habanero, jolepeno, chipotle, watered down cayenne) around the holidays from family members and most of them are enjoyable, but none can compare to this. I can only attribute the flavor to the Ghost pepper as no other sauce I have ever tried has has the particular flavor found in this sauce. The only ingredient that is ""out of the ordinary"" here to explain that is the Ghost peppers themselves.  If you've tasted the flavor of many pepper sauces and are looking for something ""new"" this has to be tried. The original Dave's insanity sauce contains a lot of pulverized, likely concentrated onion that gives it an addictive pungency that some would describe as ""smalling like something that should be used to strip paint."" The Ghost pepper variant does have a touch of garlic but does not come across to me as being anywhere near as pungent as the original (keep in mind, I liked the original, for the same sort of reason I suspect, that people take a liking to ""stinky"" powerful cheeses).<br /><br />Oh yea... one final consideration... Be careful with it, it's pretty warm. I'd suggest against pranking people with it as there is some potential liability there that is not worth it IMO."
566804,B001PQTYN2,A77F7LYGRR41G,Derek Johnson,1,1,5,1330646400,"Dollar for dollar, simply the best","Kudos to Dave for bringing great taste and amazing heat together like this,  sure the heat is extract boosted, however, for the money, this sauce is the best deal out there, no close seconds.  This one sets the standard for hot sauces of this genre.<br /><br />I've tried several hundred (maybe a thousand by now) and have been making my own sauces for over 4 years, I've grown several gardens dominated by Jolokia peppers and have made some pretty wicked all Jolokia pepper home brew versions; however, Dave's Ghost Pepper sauce is still very hard to beat.  His Ghost Pepper Naga Jolokia ""select sauce"" is a notch better, but for the price of about 3 bottles of his select sauce, you can get a gallon of Jolokia pepper sauce, and this is the quantity that I get.<br /><br />My favorite use of this sauce is to impress guests who think they can handle heat, mixing it with other commercial or homebrew sauces, putting a dab in ranch for salad, and eating it with just about everything except sweets or cereal.  I'll keep trying every hot sauce known to man leaving no stone unturned, creating my own with my own Jolokias, Habaneros (etc.), but you'll never catch me without plenty of this one around."

I am thinking that maybe people have different reactions to pepper types, because sauces with cayenne pepper, even if they are not as potent, seem ""hotter"" to me.<br /><br />The other thing that leads me to think this is that I am not an experienced chilihead, and was careful about trying this sauce carefully.  A tiny droplet on a chip led to a great smoky initial taste, and a growing burn that topped out at hot, but very manageable.  This lead to more and more over the next day, and my comfort level tops out at a small pour into a cup of chili gives it nice taste and a solid burn that I can deal with, and I can still feel hours later- in a good way.<br /><br />A fine sauce, I thought this 5 oz bottle would last forever, but I can already see that I will run out sooner than expected."

I make home made mayo and other things that I put sauce into, just so that you get the idea of the pepperhead that I am.<br /><br />I just got done devouring home made wings that I fried, and coated myself. I separated my wifes wings, for she is 8 months pregnant with our daughter, and I commenced to take a challenge set by one of my co-workers. I drenched my 10 wings in Daves Naga Jolokia blended hot sauce, not off of his Insanity line. Totally separate, and full of it's own unique flavor, I took the challenge!<br /><br />9 wings later, I saw a glass of milk that my pregnant wife was drinking so she would not get heartburn, I devoured the glass, and followed it up with a beer. I was fine after 5 to 10 minutes, and I won't say that I was in pain, just that I give respect to a sauce blended for only one drop.

566808,B001PQTYN2,A3J1NV9I9PHCRU,Roman736,1,1,4,1320278400,Kick to it,"I will preface this review with a little about myself. I only recently bought a ""hottest sauce"" while at a kind of flea market in England. It was also a ghost pepper sauce and i was shocked at the intensity of the burn. At first I was sort of proud of myself for being able to use it, but it did grow on me and I started using it as an actual condiment.  After the bottle ran out I thought I would see what was on Amazon and this sauce was ranked very highly so I bought it. So I really only have one other sauce to compare this to but here goes:<br /><br />The sauce is very hot. Almost too hot. It has a pasty consistency, almost exactly like tomato paste. Very finely ground. It has a more gummy consistency to it, like theres something added to it to give it a smoother texture though there's no such actual ingredient.<br /><br />What there is, however, as someone else pointed out, is pepper extract. It's the second listed ingredient so there must be a considerable amount. Perhaps it's what's giving this sauce that slimy texture I was eluding to earlier. This Pepper Extract doesn't state what KIND of pepper, and as it's an extract I imagine it must have gone through quite the extraction process.<br /><br />So what I'm getting at is this: the sauce feels more like a pepper extract, something which you should add small amounts of to large dishes for adding pure spice to the food. But it's missing the taste and feel of an actual hot sauce. There's little flavor, just a lot of burn. And I have to say that that's a big shame because the bhut jolokia pepper is very tasty. Almost fruity if I remember correctly.<br /><br />So I give this hot sauce 4 stars for the Effort and the level of spice, but I won't give it 5 stars because I think that goes to the generic bhut jolokia ghost pepper sauces with all the scary names and pictures on the bottle. The one I had was Fear Hot Sauce with a scary ghost woman on it, and it was much more like salsa, with little ground up pieces of ghost peppers and seeds in it and equal to, if not more burn than this one.<br /><br />If I change my mind as I go through this bottle, I'll update or comment on here again."
566809,B001PQTYN2,A1UK936HX3BZQR,Bobo_Du_Hobo,1,1,4,1318982400,It's certainly hot sauce.,"I got used to it pretty quickly, so it gets used more like ketchup now, but it really doesn't do enough to distinguish itself from other sauces. It leaves a burn more on the lips than the throat, and gives a whole new meaning to the term ""ring of fire"" about a day later."

I just went down to the kitchen to smell it again and it does have a smokey,spicey woody smell to it. Had this with grilled stired eggplant and as a testament to this sauce, it didn't destroy the flavor of the mellow eggplant stirfry. Be careful when pouring as this bottle doesn't have a restrictor. But it does come out thick and pours slow enough. Had porkchops on the side & this sauce seemed to bypass the actual food & leave you with the heat in back of the throat. Not the most flavorful hot sauce but appropriate for chilli, Crock pot stews and the like. Also, I like hot sauces to be done soon after dinner. This, you will feel long after dinner is finished in your esophagus, stomach ect. It almost wears out it's welcome. Having said that, Dave's is a definately a HEAT multiplier for food.

This is powerful, using as directed is a must.  We started with one drop and worked our way up to 9 drops in a cupfull of wing sauce.  9 drops are perfect for us.  This most definitely has a heat and kick of it's own kind.  If you like HOT and I mean standing on the sun hot, this is for you...but do use it as directed on the bottle and start small."

There was another brand too, Melinda's or Meranda's...something, yeah. I decided to go with this one as the other had carrots and mango puree and other stuff (blah). I'm sure this is too make it not so hot but I figured this might cover up it's natural taste too.<br /><br />So I stopped at Taco Bell on the way home. Figured start with something mild and got a ranchero chicken soft taco. Put one drop of this stuff and smeared it around. Not bad. Complimented it nicely. Second was a meximelt. One drop only again. This time it seemed they merged together and boosted each others spices. By the time I was done I had a nice long heat going and some sweats which lasted untill I got home.<br /><br />You know when you take a shot of hard liquor on an empty stomach? That burn? Imagine that burn slooooowly moving through your system. Yeah, it' like that. I'm sure it will kill any parasites living in your intestinal tract. Might even remove any bubble gum you swallowed as a kid.<br /><br />Next day, tried it again, this time on a burger. Threw some ranch on it and tried 2 drops this time. Got to my second burger and knew if I did 2 drops again that I might be in trouble, so went with only 1 drop.<br /><br />1 or 2 drops per item seems to be the right amount. Pouring this stuff on like it was Tapatio WILL without a doubt lead to problems!! But I will be taking this to work for all those Tapatio junkies and others who just eat raw chilis straight up. Hehe, let's see if they think they're still macho now, huh?!! This stuff is deceiving! Seems fine at first, but man o man, that heat will catch up and bite you! I have bought the habanero version of Tabasco and didn't care for it. That was mainly vinegar with way too much of a black pepper type taste. It is hot, but I ended up throwing that away. This however, I definetly will be buying more of!!! It may overpower your food if you use too much of it, but for most part it merges with your food and creates a new flavor. Those who said it tasted bad or metallic must have had a bad batch.<br /><br />By the way, me, i'm not....well wasn't a big chili person untill recently. I used that mild sauce (aka ""weak sauce"") up untill a few years ago. So I haven't trained myself into eating stuff as hot as this. Pretty much an average guy with a growing interest for new things : )<br /><br />update: finally did try that Melinda's version of Naja. Did not care for it at all!

I put hot sauce on pretty much everything and habanero started to loose its umph some time ago.  After preparing some spaghetti, I turned the bottle upside down and tried to shake the paste-like sauce into my bowl.  Excited, I began to smack the bottle.  I probably knocked 6-7 drops into my bowl.  Then I read the bottle, which belatedly instructed me to use one drop.  About 4-5 mins into dinner it hit me; my lips went numb and I began to sweat.  Shortly thereafter my nose began to run.  I went a little bit lighter on the next bowl- like 3 drops.  This was still extremely hot- I continued to sweat and became a little dizzy.  I don't see this stuff bringing a grown man down.  However, it is a half hour later and I think that I am high.  I am also afraid of what tomorrow might bring.  Although this is a must have for those who like hot sauce, you should seriously be weary... it is indeed hot!"

High School Student, bored and wanting to buy some cool stuff. I tend to blow all of my money on cool internet stuff... I figured hot sauce was the next best route to take. I've tried a lot of neat stuff from cool organic pills that change bitter foods to sweet and insane prank sprays, but, I figured this would be my next step in the process.<br /><br />Wow. Just wow. I bought this stuff last week and it arrived this Friday, after picking it up with a good friend of mine, Brandon, at the post office, we headed home. I opened the package and we both vastly underestimated this product. He took a lot of this stuff. A lot. Probably a good-sized spoonful, at once. He was crying. A sheen of sweat covered his face as he fell on the kitchen floor, panting. Water, milk, bread, nothing worked. It was pure agony. He is a spicy fan, so, I was surprised to see this from him. Hesitant myself, as I'm not a big fan of spicy foods, I tried it. I saw the darkness. My left ear felt like it was about to explode and there was a trail of fire leading down my esophagus.<br /><br />I began to stumble around my kitchen, grabbing popsicles and milk and water. I had vastly underestimated the potential of this sauce. It is the destroyer of worlds. I'm not experienced with this stuff, but, my friend is, and it is the hottest thing he's ever had by miles. This stuff is 400x hotter than tabasco sauce on the Scoville scale.<br /><br />I invited my friends Rob, Matt and Cyrus over. Rob barely had a dab and nearly died, Matt took a small amount on a spoon and then downed a glass of milk and said ""That's nothing"" and smirked, then, a moment later, began swearing and freaking out, grabbing his bottle of fruit juice he brought over and chugging it. Cyrus began to cry and pant heavily. This stuff is amazing. Simply amazing. I added one good sized drop to some tomato soup I made for dinner, as well as a lot of other delicious spices (I'm great at makin'  the stuff) and it really added a lot of flavor and a good amount of heat without making it overbearing.<br /><br />This sauce tastes really good and, as long as you aren't making your friends eat the stuff straight out to witness their horrified reactions, it will last an extremely long time. Do not drink this stuff straight out of the bottle without putting it on some sort of food. Trust me, unless you're looking for a kick, this is not a joke.

I tried it out with a Baltimore City cop and we were on our knees for 10 minutes, He said it was almost as bad as pepper spray and this was from a tooth-pick dab straight. My little brother screamed and I had eye sweats, serious pain followed by drug like euphoria.<br /><br />Now, if you use it like food and put on or in something, it is much more manageable.<br /><br />This bottle will end up living in many people's fridges forever, but it works great as a heat source for chili and is very tasty on chicken. If you just use it to harm your friends as a party trick, that's fine, but it has a nice flavor when consumed with a little restraint.<br /><br />The ""real deal"", seriously hot enough for any purpose, will probably keep deer out of your garden."

I had used about 1/3 of the bottle so I knew what I was getting myself into. I must have not realized that the oil was too hot to add liquid to without causing it to vaporize. Instantly after pouring it in it began to boil violently. A sizeable cloud of Dave's hot sauce quickly formed above the pan. I thought it would be OK at first. I backed off after getting a small whiff of it. It was very potent--like mace. After about 25 seconds I couldn't stop coughing but I continued cooking thinking that just the small whiff had gotten into the wrong place in my throat and I would soon return to normal. Little did I know that it's vapors were spreading throughout the house. Within minutes my roommates were coughing across the house. My dog was also wheezing.<br />After opening all the windows and doors in the house and turning some fans on I ate my egg/vegetable patty sandwich.

I'll focus on what jumped out at me in particular. First off, when you open up the bottle (after shaking it to death, just like you should on all extract sauces) you notice an aroma distinctly vinegar, with naga fruitieness and a hint of garlic. The taste is just amazing! You can't even taste the extract over the powerful naga sweetness. The one area you will surely notice the extract is in your stomach. Never use this stuff on an already empty stomach, best to prime the pumps. Even an iron gut may fall pray to uncontrollable stomach cramps. And yes, this stuff is pretty hot. Way to hot for most people in fact, even though I was only able to make my bottle last a week (did I mention that I eat whole naga jolokia peppers with no liquid or food?).

I have the 5oz. bottle at home and have nearly consumed it in that time, and also keep a smaller bottle (obtained from the 4-pack gift crate) at work.  The odor/flavor is reminiscent of Tabasco, but with a level of bite that would grab ANYBODY's notice.<br /><br />First, I should say that I never use this directly as a food topping, but instead blend it into a sauce of one sort or another.  I practically live off of Bird's Eye Lightly Sauced vegetables (one of which is a penne in alfredo sauce, another is rigatoni/vegetables in tomato parmesan), and this stuff complements them nicely.  Cut a hole in the bag, pour a liberal dose in, and shake the bag up until the contents are thoroughly mixed.  In the case of the alfredo sauce, I enjoy the heat at the point where the sauce has taken to a light orange tinge, but mileage may vary.  It mixes nicely with ketchup as well.  I would recommend a 1:10 ratio between the hot sauce and whatever base you're combining it with, but this is purely a matter of preference.<br /><br />I would only assume that if you're reading this, you already know the heat that a ghost pepper packs, and if you want scare stories feel free to read the other reviews.

It showed up packaged nicely in big thick bubble wrap contained within an innocent-looking plain shipping box.  Didn't know it had arrived until I checked my tracking status through amazon and seen that it had delivered.  Went out to the mailbox a little bit ago and brought it in.  Not sure how long it was out there, but I think it was partially frozen (current outside temp is 10 degrees).  However - frozen or not - this stuff means business.<br /><br />I actually hesitated for a bit before breaking the plastic seal and opening the bottle.  Tried telling myself that I may as well let it thaw before opening - yet I think I was just stalling.  For better or worse, though, I decided to open it up and give it a try.  Using a small narrow measuring spoon (1/8 teaspoon I believe) I put a small dab of this lava-colored stuff on the end of the spoon.  Hesitated for a bit longer before placing spoon in my mouth and seeing what it was all about.  It took roughly 1 second before my tongue gave me that info in short order.<br /><br />Immediate taste was very pleasant with a taste of its own for this particular pepper sauce.  I am by no means a 'chili head' or enjoy eating a lot of hot sauce with my food, but I can say that I did enjoy the flavor more than tobasco or habanero sauce.  However, the flavor was almost immediately dwarfed by an intense burning sensation on my tongue which made its way down my throat.  After about a minute or so the burning was in full effect with sinuses cleared and my complete undivided attention directed toward pain management.  Call me a wuss, but I ended up going for a glass of milk about 3 or 4 minutes after tasting a very small dab of this stuff.  It's truly amazing how fast milk can provide nearly instant relief from this type of pain.  Nearly an hour later and my tongue still has a slight burning sensation lingering where initial contact was made.<br /><br />Use with caution.  As others have stated - the bottle does not have a regulator cap.  Mine had a thick consistency which was probably due to it being partially frozen.  But even at a very cold temperature, this hot sauce will seem like a gift from Prometheus himself."

He didn't think so himself. After trying it myself I can say it's hot enough. Up there with a bottle of habanero. See thing is after a chili is as hot as a habanero you really don't need anything hotter. If you pour more than a teaspoon at a time you are asking for trouble/pain. Just a single drop was enough to get my eyes to water and tongue to burn all over. I was disappointed that it didn't get hotter over time since I saw some other people reviewing this chili where they said it got hotter over time and burned all the way down to their stomach.

I thought that maybe I could trigger my own endorphins to take up some of the weight. I started with jalapenos, and that worked for a little while, but it's a lot to eat. So I tried some regular grocery-store hot sauces, and I was swigging them just to get a decent burn. Then I decided to go for something very hot and found Dave's Ghost Pepper Naga Jolokia Sauce. Little dabs with my finger to my tongue causes a good burn, but it took a bit more than a dab to get the endorphin burn going. Each endorphin burn gets rid of the headache/sinus pain for about an hour. Still, it's the best I've tried yet. I've read it runs 650,000 scoville units, at 130x the heat of a jalapeno."

We began using the pod coffee system years ago when the Home Cafe systems were introduced (before the current K-cup models). The pod coffee system is perfect for our household, and Senseo is just about the only manufacturer still offering the pods. My husband rotates the Columbian with Sumatra and Expresso pods, but the Columbian is his favorite, and he says that it is a very rich and flavorful blend. The aroma when the coffee is brewing is wonderful, and for anyone who only drinks a few cups, this system is probably as cost effective as brewing a pot of coffee and throwing out half the pot; plus, with this system, every cup is fresh, not stale or left-over. The Columbian is a rich and dark blend and perfect for coffee drinkers who want a traditional flavor of coffee."

They look just like the picture on the box, they are so soft and chewy and the taste is delicious. They come in a vacume sealed package so I suggest once you open them you place the entire package minus the box in a gallon sized zip lock bag because they will go stale quickly. I experienced this when my hubby was ""sleep walking"" and opened up the box and placed the package back in the box and the next morning they were all hard and stale. We ended up eating them over the course of a couple days with milk/coffee and dunking them. Another way I store them is in a air tight container I picked up at the doller store and placed each cookie in a sandwich bag and placed them in the jar. That way when I'm packing the hubby's lunch I just grab a cookie in its sandwich bag and throw it into his lunch pale. I mention my husband alot because he constantly talks about these cookies to his friends, we had one of them come over the other day and he ran over to the jar and had him try one. His friend was HOOKED now he is also a loyal customer as is his wife. We don't really care for the raisin variety which is sad because I typically love raisin cookies.

Only 8g of sugar per cookie, and 5g of fat which is a tad higher than I would have liked but I would guess if they had cut more fat out they would have sacrificed a lot of the taste. The cookies are a little smaller than I was expecting, and like others have previously said they are kind of dry, but neither factor really bothers me.

If I need a quick dinner, I take an 8 piece cut-up chicken, pour a little olive oil over it, rub it in, then sprinkle the rotisserie seasoning over it (maybe 1-3 tbsp), rub that in, too, and that's it. No salt and pepper is needed.  Sometimes I cut up onions and put them in the bottom of the pan. I bake everything at 375, covered, for an hour, or until I see it's done, then uncover it to let it brown...best chicken, ever! And the seasoning is kosher, so it's perfect for Shabbos chicken.

I'm not a coffee guru...I can't really go in depth about the flavors, aromas, depth, etc....I can tell you that with Lavazza Cafe Espresso i get a palpable caffeine jolt from a 14 gram double espresso extracted over 20 seconds on my gaggia. Not really fond of the taste. I use Cafe Espresso for iced espressos and americanos. I can sort of taste some chocolate and nutty flavors, it does have a bit of a sweet taste, but it seems to have a lingering bitterness. Lavazza In Blue has a cleaner aftertaste and is more chocolatey. In Blue is a bit smoother as well. Illy Is my favorite, clean after taste, not bitter, smoother than both. Plus it seems to have a bit more caffeine kick...but i think that's just mental or maybe because i drink Illy as a straight shot. If you don't mind spending the money, I would buy Illy. If you find it ludicrous to spend $12 on 8 ounce coffee, which i doubt since you probably have a nice machine if you are reading this, I would buy Lavazza In Blue (i can get it for $8 at World Market). If you just want a preground espresso to make coffee drinks, or iced drinks and don't want to spend too much nor buy a burr grinder and grind your own, i would get the Lavazza Cafe Espresso. Still waiting to try Oro and Illy Dark roast.<br />Lavazza Cafe Espresso would get 3.5/5 from me. In Blue would get 4/5, Illy 4.5/5."

It tastes very similiar to Lavazza Expresso (black can).<br /><br />The body of the coffee does taste stronger and bolder than Lavazza......but not necessarily better.<br /><br />I hate to say this, but the taste of this Illy coffee tastes very close to Starbucks ""Houseblend""...but minus the bitterness of Starbucks.<br /><br />The Lavazza Expresso tastes better.  It tastes nuttier, smoother, with more of a ""mocha"" taste.  Plus, the aroma from Lavazza itself is intoxicating alone......with the Illy brewing, well....let's just say ""smells like regular coffee"".<br /><br />Is this Illy coffee smooth - yes<br />Is it bitter - no<br />Does it taste good - yes<br /><br />BUT......Does it have character??? ------- ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!!!!!!<br /><br />The Lavazza Expresso (black can) has a distinctive taste (and smell) all to it's own.......the Illy does not.<br /><br />To sum it up, it's all over-hyped on Illy Expresso coffee.

I tried both coffee made in Bialetti Moka Express Stovetop Espresso Maker.<br />My opinion - they definetely have different taste but no difference in quality. Lavazza tastes stronger, while Illy tastes softer. Thus, I cannot justify such significant difference in price - $13 per 8oz. for Illy and $5 per 8oz. for Lavazza. I personally liked Lavazza taste better.<br /><br />Illy makes grind especially for Stovetop Moka Maker which I used. Apparently it is designed to be completely filtered out  - so there is no tiny bits of grounded coffee in the final product and no powder left in cup when it is empty. For some reason I do like these little pieces in the mouth (probably it is not good for teeth). Lavazza makes just one standard ground coffee which in finer than Illy's Moka version."

They lack the fat of popcorn (except for the air popped corn which is not worth the effort).  They have a certain richness from baking, a taste which ties it right back to the beer from which it derived its malty goodness.<br />These pretzels are great in another way: you can only eat so much at any one sitting.  They take a certain effort to eat, unlike chips, so there's no danger you will eat the whole box.<br />My recommendation before eating is to part-open the bag and then break all the pretzels.  The reason is two fold: you get a variety of shapes and sizes, plus they are much easier to eat.  If you chomp into a whole pretzel, you will discover that you had dental problems that you never knew you had.  So, better not 'test' yourself and just give them a satisfying and productive bash in the bag before eating.  Enjoy..."

These chocolates are best consumed by nibbling away at them.  I've moved on to the Guylian Praline Twists, they're the same thing as the seashells but in individually wrapped form.  At my local store, the twists are less expensive than the boxed seashells, between 30-50% cheaper when looking at the price per ounce.  Since they're for me, I don't need the fancy gift packaging that the seashells have.  :)"
567118,B000LQJKI6,A1Z4LX3Q1YMF84,"Cindy A. Osterhout ""Cindy O""",2,2,5,1334880000,"These are my favorite ""in States"" chocolate goodies.","I never was much of a chocolate person. I grew up preferring Strawberry, then Vanilla, and, lastly, chocolate.<br /><br />Then when I was 35, my husband took me with him on a business trip to Switzerland. What a treat that was! Lining the main boulevards were small confectionery shops filled with cocholates the likes of which I had never, ever laid eyes upon. A tiny box of chocolates that would be about 5 inches square and hold 12 pieces of candy cost around $30. But I had no idea that Chocolate could taste so exquistely good or look so beautiful. Little candies with 3 layers of chocolate in various flavors topped with small green candy looking twigs, or hearts, or diamond shapes.<br />Truffles made with plain chocolate or all different types of liquors. If I could have afforded it, I would have eaten myself into the size of a blimp. And the sales people were so delightful, always reminding me that this box was made Today and was meant to be eaten TODAY or it would get stale. I thought about our boxes of chocolate that sit on the shelves for weeks or months and winced. Thankfully, lots of walking was required to see the sights and I was able to eat what I could afford and still not gain! It was like Heaven.<br /><br />But then, back to the States we came. Hersheys just didn't cut it anymore. So I began taste testing what I could find locally always recalling the vendors' words ""that chocolate was made today and is to be eatenn today."" I tried Truffles, I tried mixed boxes whose photos made them LOOK LIKE the insides of the tiny little boxes in Switzerland. But nothing measured up.<br /><br />One day, I was in a local store and sighted these Guylian Belgian Chocolate Sea Shells. It was my turn to bring treats to a group I go to on Thursdays. The chocolates were on sale and I had noted that the Belgian chocolates I had tried did seem fresher than the others, and tasted better than other brands shipped in Stateside. So I bought two boxes and trooped off to my meeting.<br /><br />As Soon as I had put the chocolate out, I checked to make sure that no one else had brought chocolate as a treat. Nope. Then I took one and ambled away to give them a taste. I wanted to make certain I hadn't bought something awful. So with my back turned to the group, I tried out a piece. I popped the whole thing in my mouth and went through my usualy routine for checking chocolate. I let the piece of candy just lay on my tongue for about 25 seconds until it had softened up and then began lightly and politely sucking on the chocolate. Oh my. It was fresh and had a delightful sweet chocolate taste very similar to the Swiss Chocolate I so loved. In fact, this was just a bit creamier. With little time to spare, I went ahead and bit into the piece expecting solid chocolate. But no, there was a soft inner core of ever sweeter, softer, creamier, fresher, chocolate in the center. I was Delightfully Surprised. Hating to hurry, I went ahead and chewed the piece up so that I could join the group.<br /><br />But my what an experience. I found myself going back to the counter several times during the afternoon, to get another piece of that chocolate I had brought. I urged the others to try it and each one was also very impressed with this chocolate. Where DID you get these? Were they terribly expensive? How long do they keep? Can I put them in my candy jar or will they melt? The SeaShells were an overwhelming success. I shared that I got them at the local pharmacy on the corner, that they were currently on sale, best to eat them as soon as possible, but they will keep in the freezer without problem for a year, and, yes you should be able to keep them in the candy jar as it was then winter here in Arizona, but I would not put them in a jar during the summer. I have found that even with air conditioning, delicate chocolate does not hold up well out of its box when it is hot. Somehow the candies sense the outside heat and their insides get really old and stale and melt. Ugh. Best to keep them in the fridge in the summer. If you buy them on sale as a gift, stick them in the freezer to preserve them like new.<br /><br />I am amazed at how good these are and I do pick them up on sale and pop them in the freezer for gifts, and keep them hidden in the fridge as a treat for myself. They are indeed, the best ""other country, Stateside Product"" I have found. Whatever theis company does is amazing because these tender candies stay fresh and edible for those of us here. So, I highly Recommend them as they are my favorites. I would NOT order them in the summer or when it starts to get warmish at all as they will probably melt in transit unless they are shipped in dry ice, which I do not know. But I only have them shipped in the dead of winter because it can get so warm here at any time.<br /><br />So, If you are a candy eater, and love foreighn chocolates, then get some of these. They are a wonderful treat. I hope you like them as well as I do.!"

But after TASTING these yummy morsels, we knew that these were the BEST chocolate ANYWHERE -- on sale, or not!<br /><br />A few years later, my sister came to visit.  We bought some more Gulian Belgian Chocolate Sea Shells. (don't remember if they were on sale then or not), in honour of her visit.  She took ONE bite of one....and summed up what my mom and I had thought ever since WE had first tasted them:<br /><br />  ""...I can't believe how good they are!""<br /><br />.......................................................<br /><br />THE REAL REASONS WHY THESE CHOCOLATES ARE S_O GOOD Dept.<br /><br />Many years after her visit, I was watching The History Channel, and they mentioned Belgian chocolate, and showing how it was made.  I remember the voice-over saying that Belgian chocolate is even better than French chocolate -- and giving the reasons for this.<br />1) Belgian chocolates are made from the freshest of the most fresh ingredients.  2) Belgian chocolates are made by people who take IMMENSE PRIDE in their profession, and want to make sure everything is JUST right!<br /><br />.....................................................<br /><br />FALSE ECONOMY.....DON'T GET STUCK LIKE I DID!! Dept.<br /><br />I recently made the mistake of trying to find a ""Belgian Chocolate Bargain"" on Amazon.  Believe it or not, it was an 11-pound BLOCK of Dark Belgian chocolate.  WORST culinary mistake I ever bought, (I won't mention my home-made kitchen disasters here.) The greater the cocoa content, the harder the chocolate, you see.  I don't know if it was mentioned or not....but I probably would have bought this anyway, so delighted am I with BELGIAN chocolate.  I wound up with something SO huge, and SO hard, that I was lucky a friend of mine's husband was able to break it into twelve smaller blocks -- with his home-workshop SAW!  He didn't dare break it into slices, because this could have BROKEN his saw!  So I am left with 12 blocks of approximately 1 1/2"" x 2"" x 3"", that I will probaby have to grate, then powder in my blender.  IF, that is, I don't get disgusted enough to throw the whole thing out.  Sadly, these hard BLOCKS of Belgian chocolate are no longer fresh....or that tasty, either..........<br /><br />...................................................<br /><br />THE ( YUMMY! ) BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />So, for a treat, DON'T look for a super-bargain....even in Belgian Chocolates.  Save money by fore-swearing pizza for a few months, or other such economies.  GUYLIAN BELGIAN CHOCOLATE SEA-SHELLS, (here in the 8.82 ounce ""REGULAR economy"" pack), offers bite-size morsels of true confectionary ART!  They are better than ANY chocolate you have ever tasted -- unless you have tasted Guylian Belgian Chocolate Sea-Shells before!  Give them to anyone you appreciate and admire....including yourself.  And you, (or whomever you give them to), will surely echo my sister's words:<br /><br />  "".....I can't believe how good they are!"""

Guylian shells are definitely not something you'll confuse with fresh Belgian pralines.  I'm assuming the freshness issue accounts for the difference in taste between these and something like Corne Toison D'Or in Brussels, or any one of the really good Belgian chocolate-makers whose products are flown here from Belgium and sold immediately or disposed of so that customers only get freshly-made chocolates.<br /><br />Providing one understands these are made economically to survive on the shelf, and are not to be compared to the amazing, delectable but quickly-spoiled types for which one either goes to Brussels or pays a fortune in shipping, I think these make a great, relatively inexpensive chocolate."

The oil is not at all like the seller/manufacturer had described it to be. Doesn't smell or tastes like Hass avocados. Hardly. Tastes more like cooked leafy greens. I am beginning to believe that buying avocado oil online is probably not the best way to go. This is the second brand of avocado oil (also tried San Pietro Chilean Organic avocado oil) I've purchased and both have been horrible. Maybe manufacturers of these oils should be more honest in describing the tastes of these oils so that the consumer would know what to expect. If they say it should taste mild and buttery than that's what one expects. Not citrus-like or herbaceous like described by others consumers. Also, I've read that avocado oil can go rancid despite the date on the bottle. That if it smells and tastes odd then probably it's rancid or on its way there. I've come across lots of oils in my lifetime and never the tought of it being rancid has ever entered my mind. Probably because I've never really come across any until now. Maybe avocado oil is a far to delicate of an oil that needs to be stored and handled in a special manner which too many sellers don't know how to. Anyway, I think I would give some other oil a try.<br /><br />Note: This is a follow up to my review. I wouldn't do business with this company ever again. Besides selling me a bad product, they make me responsible for shipping costs. So that means that instead of the $21.97 reimbursement,  I will only be credited $11.99 and they would not do so unless I ship them back the product which I had to pay $5.  to get it back to them.

I have no idea why I didn't hop on this avocado oil train long ago but I just discovered it at Whole Foods.  This takes salads and meals to a whole other taste level.<br /><br />I try to have a monounsaturated fat at every meal due to the health benefits and the scores of studies as well as personal experience showing they assist in weight loss when combined with a regular proper calorie diet. (These are the good fats) so I include lots of avocados and olive oil in my diet naturally....I'll make salads, pastas, hummus, tapanades for sandwiches, combine beans and corn with avocados etc, make a california veggie burger cooked in olive oil and topped with avocados, red peppers, etc in a pita...so replacing my olive oil with avocado oil has brought on wonderful new flavors.<br /><br />That said, with culinary training under my belt, I'm exceptional at picking out individual flavors in foods and I taste olive oil as a component here as well.  This is made by olivado which I'm assuming is likely an olive oil company by the name so it could simply be they are using the same presses to press out the avocados.  It isn't something that bothers me as I love olive oil, but it gives the avocado flavor a milder taste so I'm anxious to try some other brands as well.<br /><br />I personally feel this is an oil everyone should have on hand.  The flavor is a whole new depth when using oil that is unique and unexpected and I'll always have some, no matter what brand, in my own cabinet. I find myself reaching for this to replace other oils in recipes very often."

Price is high and 1 can lasts only 4 days.  Manufactured in England.  Comparable American made product called Elecare, just as good, slightly better price, but if you go to the Neocate manufacterer website and call their customer service you can request your first sample can free.  Good product for infants with milk protien allergies.  We were concerned about strange colored soiled diaper and pediatrician tested it and came up positive for blood in stool.  Doc started us on elemental formulas first.  Two are widely available.  Similac Alimentum and Enfamil Nutramigen.  Enfamil adds DHA to their formula in an attempt to make it more comparable to breast milk but our infant couldn't digest it and passed it as a thick yellow paste.  If you sign up at Similac website they will mail you samples of their other formulas but also several coupons for $5 off any of their formulas which really helped offset the cost.  Be prepared though.  All of these smell horrid and taste nasty as a powder, not as bad once mixed with water.  Fortunately infant tastebuds are not as developed. Baby still had a lot of reflux and gas even when we tried adding every colic remedy/gripe water on the market, which also drove up our feeding costs.  Pediatrician warned these rememdies are good for occassinal not chronic use.  So we stepped up to the Neocate.  After making my first purchase on Amazon, I got bolder and started poking around ebay.  Occasionally finding a better price but be sure to check shipping charges.  Some people make it look like they are selling it cheaper and jack up their shipping charges .  And there is all the drama, bidding wars and you can get sucked in just like in gambling so set your price point and stick to it.  A newer better offer is born daily. Sellers are not as reliable as Amazon and don't always package product well enough to prevent cans from denting.  And keep in mind, most infants will only need this product for the first 9 months to one year and then you can switch to soy or less expensive alternatives.  Good luck and good nights."

(It's ok. I can make up words. I work for the government.) I really like the high potassium content, too. (Note--I am NOT a doctor.) As the sweltering East Coast heat and humidity approaches, potassium helps with the fluid you lose. Whether you are on fluid pills, or working outside in the eat, or running and jogging for your health, or hiking, or your children are playing and running in the heat, it's a real good idea to keep those potassium levels up. Low potassium levels, as I understand it, can be harmful, leading to cramps in your legs or worse--maybe even making you pass out. Anyway, this is good and it sure tastes a lot better to me than Gatoraid (yuk). So, check it out, and read up on ""potassium"" before the heat gets here."

Really light flavor, refreshing, perfect bit of citrus.  I decided to try a different flavor, so I bought a 12-pack of the Peach & Mango.  The name sounded appealing - how can anyone mess up peach, I figured.  Let me say this - it is honestly one of the foulest things I've ever tasted.  I cannot articulate the taste because it's so uniquely bad - you will have to try it for yourself (which I don't recommend).  I was able to drink half of one container before pouring the rest out in disgust.  Reminds me of when I was a teenager and I was forcing down my first mixed alcoholic drink and the taste was nearly unbearable.  I had my friend try a container and his was awful, too.  I eventually threw out the remaining 9 cartons (note: I used a 3rd one to trick another friend into trying this repugnant crap as a gag).<br /><br />I don't know if I got a bad batch or if this is how Peach & Mango is supposed to taste but I am thoroughly dissatisfied.<br /><br />Update: it's been months since I wrote this review and I stand by it.  My friend bought a separate batch and the taste was identical.  Peach & Mango is the worst VitaCoco flavor, in my opinion.  Honestly, it's one of the worst beverages I've ever tasted - period - next to a can of unsweetened Oolong tea I purchased at Wegman's.

It's worth noting that you can vary the size of the rolls considerably, and I find that making 12 is about the right size and consistency for sandwiches/munching on.  Much bigger and it's just too much to eat.

This bread is great and also makes a fantastic pizza crust, it doesn't have the strong aftertaste that some of the GF breads have.  I've never used a breadmaker, always make it by hand, I wear latex gloves to mix it so my hands don't get gluey, I follow the instructions exactly, and it has come out fine every time.  I preheat/warm the oven to 150 or so degrees for 5-10 mins before I start the dough, then shut off the oven.  Spray Pam in the bowl and on top of the dough, cover the bowl and dough with a wet towel, and let it rise in warmed oven.  After risen an hour I then wear gloves again, cover a pizza pan with E.V. flavored olive oil, and spread the dough as thin as possible in the pan because it will rise when baked.  If anyone would like to see what the final pizza looks like I have it posted on Facebook under Gluten free Professionals group.  I also freeze unused dough, take it out the night before, and it makes great bread, rolls, or pizza and the dough is even more workable when it's cold.  Been using Schar for years without a problem, I have a feeling the folks had trouble due to the breadmakers, I work the dough by hand with gloves and it only takes a few minutes.  Remember the ingredients need to be lukewarm for the yeast.  I also plan to make onion bread and maybe olive bread with the Schar mix.  I have also make a spinach pie roll with this dough, spread it out, layer sauted fresh spinach and pepperoni and provolone cheese, roll it up, and bake, it's great.  I have also made sauted Calzones, and fried dough (doughboys) which are fantastic with a bit of sugar, just saute in a bit of olive oil in a nonstick pan and the dough fluffs up great and they taste fantastic.

Schar products have me hooked! I made the white bread last night and it turned out better than any of the others we've tried and don't come across as too heavy on any one type of flour. I do not recommend using a bread machine for the mix. Why? It's a simple matter to throw the ingredients in a mixer and they don't require any fancy treatment. Pat the batter into a greased and floured loaf pan, stick it someplace warm with a wet towel over it and wait. That's probably the most important thing... It doesn't give a time on the box, it just says ""until doubled"". Give it time... Took over an hour for me, but it was a bit cooler in the house than it probably would have liked. Baked it for exactly the time mentioned on the box and placed the loaf pan on a cookie sheet filled with water. Loaf came out looking like it might be under-cooked, but it wasn't!

The bread gets a nice crust and pretty good flavor.<br /><br />When I make my bread, I'm more successful in the oven rather than the bread maker.  It's absolutely key that you put a pyrex of water in the rack under the bread pan when you bake this bread - otherwise you get a pretty tough and dry crust.  Be sure to put the pyrex in the oven when you preheat the oven. That way when the bread dough goes in, the oven is already humid.  Obviously you can't do that in the bread maker - so oven is the only way to go.<br /><br />I have also found that adding an extra 1/2 cup of water gives the bread a bit more volume.  I also add 2 tbls of honey - this is not much in terms of sweetness, but it does mellow out any unusual flavors that are always found in GF bread.<br /><br />If you're new to GF, this a great bread to try."

I followed some advice here and ended up with the dough overflowing, but maybe I did something wrong...  Anyway, I managed to get the just-starting-to-cook dough out of the machine and into 2 bread pans (that dough had REALLY risen!)and cooked them separately somewhat according to the directions on the box (since it was already partially cooked, and had an extra cup of water in it - and I did not put a pan of water under it while baking in the oven)and they came out looking unusual (very white on top) but were incredibly tasty!!  I'll second that it tastes a lot like a french bread.  Kind of crispy and chewy crust, very moist and fluffy inside.  Nothing like gf bread at all.  No one could believe how good it was!  I really think this would make an excellent pizza dough since the crust is so crispy and chewy.  Of course, these were the results of having it flop in the bread machine first.  I hope I can duplicate my results while avoiding another disaster! EXCELLENT BREAD!  Now, if only they could keep it in stock...<br /><br />Edited to add:  I've now tried this with less water (about 2 and 1/2 cups) and the loaf came out perfect!  I have also had my machine prepare the dough and before it started the baking cycle I took it out, divided it into 4, flattened circles (like pizza crusts), filled it with meat, sauce and cheese, and then folded it over and pinched the edges and baked it at 425 for about a 1/2 hour to 35 mins.  Mmmm.... CALZONES!  Absolutely delicious, crisp crust and very tasty!<br /><br />The main problem with this product is that it does not brown.  It is always white on the outside.

(This brings the total to 3 cups of water.)<br /><br />Following the package directions, you really need to eat this bread the day you bake it (so make sure you make it in the morning!). Fortunately, this has not been a problem at my house. Adding the extra cup of water, it was still edible the next day.<br /><br />I did put the bread in the oven to rise for 30 minutes, with the oven temperature set at ""warm"".<br /><br />-------------------<br /><br />Since writing the above, I purchased a bread machine. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00067REBU"">Sunbeam 5891 2-Pound Programmable Breadmaker</a><br /><br />After 5 or 6 trial-and-error attempts, all moderately successful, I have cracked the code to making this bread mix work optimally in this machine. Here it is:<br /><br />Instead of putting the wet ingredients in first (as the machine's booklet instructs), put the DRY ingredients in first, then the wet ingredients. Use the settings:<br /><br />1 Basic<br />1 1/2 pound loaf<br />Dark crust<br /><br />While following the directions (of the machine) will work, following my directions leads to bread that rises half again as high. This yields a fluffier texture which, frankly, tastes less gluten-free. (You know what I'm talking about!) The individual slices of bread are then so huge that you can literally cut one in half and make a decent-size PBJ."

Mongaraz ""colores64""",0,0,5,1262131200,"At last, a TASTY gluten-free bread mix!","I could not believe the taste - I baked it using my stand mixer (I hate my bread machines both of them ! just don't get good results using them), but I followed the directions EXACTLY for using a stand mixer (the dough was a lot stiffer than the usual gluten-free breads) including placing the pan of hot water in the oven - It did not brown outside, but I baked it for the recommended time - no longer - cut myself a slice as soon as it cooled, and it was so good I wanted to cry - taste and texture very like a chewy French bread.  After 3 days sitting at room temperature, still good, but drying slightly (no crumbling) - after 3 more days in the refrigerator, tastes like a good chewy English muffin, toasted, and STILL no crumbling.  Just don't let the white-ish exterior fool you into baking it longer.  This is one I am glad to see in Amazon's product offerings, I know I will always have it in my kitchen - and the mixing couldn't be simpler (I live at 4,400 ft. but did not adjust for altitude - perfect loaf, anyhow !)"

Our first attempt was a near disaster!  The dough was hard to mix, did not rise enough, and came out of the oven unbrowned and tough.  Since I have baked bread for many years, I decided to try some modifications to see if the end product could be improved.<br /><br />I mixed the dough using a stand mixer, rather than by hand in a bowl.  I added one TBS of sugar, and increased the water from two to nearly three cups.  Before putting the bread in the oven I brushed the top with melted butter.<br /><br />The result was a nicely browned loaf which had risen nicely. The texture and flavor was very satisfactory.  Now we can have nice tasting white bread available all the time."

My MIL received them in Oklahoma on the 14th, and they were in beautiful condition.<br /><br />The flowers shipped with individual tubes for each stem, so they were kept very fresh. Also, when I stopped by my in-law's house for Easter more than a week later, the orchids still looked fabulous! I will definitely order from this seller again if they keep their prices competitive.

Puhlease.<br /><br />Although I was given an estimated delivery date of two or three days, they arrived the next day, just as I specified. And they are GORGEOUS, according to Mom. They arrived just in time to awe my stepsister and stepfather, who had brought a generic bouquet that probably cost just as much as my fabulous orchids. I wish I could've seen their faces.<br /><br />Mom says there are at least a dozen stems. She is just loving telling all the nurses and her visitors that her daughter sent the spectacular orchids.<br /><br />Little-known fact: orchids last longer than any other cut flower. They will still be beautiful when Mom goes home next week, and probably for at least a week after that.

Well, I finally talked myself to take a chance and send these Orchids and I am really glad I did.

She told us that the flowers were perfect and that they would send us a picture in a few days so that we could see how beautiful thay were. Sure enough three days later we received an e-mail thanking us along with a picture of the orchids, and they were right, the flowers were beautiful and you could see in the picture that only half of the buds had bloomed and that along with the other half, they would probably last an other week.

Unlike dehydrated apples, which are chewy, these chips are super thin and crispy.  But they get that crispiness because of the oil added when they make them.  Sure they have less fat than potato chips, but don't kid yourself that these are a low-fat snack.<br /><br />Still, these chips are a fantastic treat when you want something that crunches much like a potato chip, and they have much less fat and far more flavor than a potato chip.  But there's another trade off - you don't have the sodium of potato chips, but you do have extra sugar.<br /><br />I originally found these chips in my local coop at about twice the price I'm paying for them on Amazon, so I was thrilled to find them here.  Even at the high price, I occasionally bought a bag.  With the lower price, I can keep them on hand.<br /><br />All in all, despite the fact that these aren't the most nutritious snack out there and they're more expensive than an individual bag of potato chips, I keep them in my cupboard as I (and my family) love them.  There are supposedly 2.5 servings a bag, but I doubt many of us get that many servings out of a bag.  These chips are really tasty and satisfying - and once you open a bag, you'll likely keep eating until they're all gone.<br /><br />Why do I give these five stars despite the fat, sugar, and price?

Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. They put a caffeine meter on the box to compare this tea with cola and coffee beverages-this tea has 5 mg of caffeine compared to 90 in a cup of drip coffee. This tea is reported as having a high level of antioxidants-higher than green tea. The level of antioxidants and information about them would be a good addition. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface. Here is a poem they put on this box:<br /><br />""Ten thousand flowers in the spring, the moon in autumn, a cool breeze in summer, snow in winter.

They are airpacked in a thick plastic bag, and there are about 6 or 7 different kinds of olives from small dark purple to green and everything in between.  The liquid was clear with no added pieces of peppers or stems or extra bits of herbs.  I filled 4 Glad containers with the olives adding a little sea salt and water.  As we eat these olives, I pour off the liquid and give them a quick rinse.  I have heard of adding oil and vinegar but these olives are super without add-ins.  The price is fantastic especially if you subscribe and save.  I am tired of buying rubbery olives in jars at the store or wondering about the cleanliness and safety of the olive bar.  It's a life changing experience to have a big stash of olives in the fridge just waiting for me to enjoy them.  I'm so glad to find this quality item!  And they arrived in 2 days!

567529,B003JO0VV2,AWG9MM2IQ4CQA,"Greg Johnson ""Thorgrym""",34,35,5,1292889600,Enjoying Wholesome Kefir,"Since I began following <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0425204138"">The Maker's Diet</a> in order to improve my health, I have been interested in adding kefir as regular part of my daily nutrition.  Sadly, all of the kefir that I have been able to find is both low-fat and pasteurized.  As well, many varieties have undesirable additives (fructose, preservatives, etc.).  Recently, I have been reading more information about the benefits of kefir, so I began to look for a way to make my own.  I am already drinking raw milk from a local farm and have been making yogurt from that, so making kefir seemed like a good idea.  A health food store that I frequent sells kefir starter but it requires that the milk be heated first (according to the directions on the package) - essentially pasteurizing the milk and negating all of the benefits of raw milk in the process.  My search brought me to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JO0VV2"">Milk Kefir Grains</a>.  At first, I was a little put off by the price.  When I learned that the kefir grains can be used indefinitely with proper care and feeding, I decided to place my order.<br /><br />When I received my package of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JO0VV2"">Milk Kefir Grains</a>, I was a little concerned by the condition.  The box was shipped in a cardboard 'sleeve' that had been crushed.  The product box was considerably flatter than it should have been, but the small, sealed 'envelope' containing the dried kefir grains inside was unharmed.  My suggestion would be to revise the packaging or choose a better shipping carton to prevent/minimize any potential damage.  That said, the damage was purely cosmetic.<br /><br />When my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JO0VV2"">Milk Kefir Grains</a> arrived, I immediately set to reading the included instructions.  While I was a little dismayed at having to wait a week (or more) for the grains to be revitalized (by putting them in fresh milk daily until they are ready), I was eager to start enjoying homemade kefir!  I wasn't entirely positive if the grains were fully ready after 7 days, so I gave it another 3 days.  Even though the instructions say to start with smaller quantities of milk (about 8 oz.) for the first batch of kefir and stepping up to the desired amount, I made my first batch out of a full quart.  It came out great!<br /><br />I am currently making my 4th batch.  To store the grains between batches, I simply put them in a jar with about 6 oz. of milk stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days until I am ready to make a new batch.<br /><br />If you are looking to enjoy the health benefits of homemade kefir, I recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JO0VV2"">Milk Kefir Grains</a> by Cultures for Health.  Be patient - it is worth the wait."

Who knew kefir could be made at home so easily?! The insert with the small package of minuscule ""grains"" is a bit intimidating and you may think there is some difficult process to be followed. But it's so easy. Just place the grains in a cup of milk and put it on a shelf in the kitchen. Pour out the milk (just not the grains) and pour in fresh milk every 24 hours. For the first 2-3 days as the grains start stretching out their legs, growing their muscles, pushing and shoving each other, the kefir may be watery or bitter at first. After a couple of days, you start to get sweet-tasting coagulated kefir every 24 hours or so. You will save and save so much you won't know what to do with your money."

It also had (& still has) their name on it as ""by Cultures of Health LLC"" but then further down is says ""Ships from and sold by Lifetime Kefir.""  I just want to clarify for everyone out there, who like me thought I was buying from a specific COMPANY that sells milk kefir, that this is not sold through Cultures for Health & it is not sponsored or affiliated with them in any way.  I contacted Cultures for Health today and the customer service lady said that they are not affiliated with this ""Lifetime Kefir"". I also received my kefir grains in a plastic baggie & wrapped in about 5 more plastic baggies, all smooshed up flat, and looking nothing like the cauliflower looking kefir grains you see pictures of.  Needless to say I was a little freaked out.  I decided to just try it out & see if the kefir grew and 'worked'.  -----  THAT BEING SAID ..... the kefir grew wonderfully! and has tripled or quadrupled in a months time.  I also sent the seller a question after working with and growing my kefir for about 2 or 3 days and he gave me a quick, polite, fairly thorough answer. Customer service seemed just good ... and quick.  I started with making about 1c of kefir and it was fizzy, clumpy/watery, weird.  I didn't know what I was supposed to be looking for but I guess this is normal and I just kept working with it each day changing the milk out and making new kefir.  It took about 1-2 weeks before it was producing well and I was making good kefir (not fizzy, but creamy now).  I was slowly figuring out how to work with the product.  I now make a quart jar of kefir daily.  I switch out the grains/kefir each morning and am left with about 3-4 cups of kefir each day.  All-in-all, I think the product is good. *****UPDATE 7/13/11******:  Since the initial review here, I have contacted the seller about some things & have had wonderful, very polite, and very quick customer service.  There is nothing bad to say at all about the customer service with this seller, in my opinion.  He seems to go out of the way to make sure the buyer is fully satisfied with the product.  And the product seems great.  My grains have grown tremendously and I have probably 1 to 1 1/2 CUPS of kefir GRAINS now.  That is all from about 1T of smooshy, yellow looking 'stuff' (kefir grains) that I initially got from the seller.  It took a couple weeks for them to start working ""normally"" and looking more ""normal"" but just give them some time and they seem to come through and make great kefir.  The only reason for less than 5 stars is simply because I feel like there still is a little misleading advertising in the product.  It appears this seller (Lifetime Kefir) has a few different kefir grain ads/products on amazon & the one that I bought from ([...]) shows that it is ""by: Cultures for Health, LLC"" and ""shipped and sold by Lifetime Kefir"".  I thought I was buying the grains from Culture for Health through a middle-man, so to speak.  When actually it is not a Cultures for Health product at all.  Maybe no big deal to others, but it was for me.  It ended up being a great product in the end though."

When re-hydrated there was a very tiny amount of actual grains. I put them in a jar with milk on a seedling mat to keep them the right temperature (our house is cool at night) and was very careful, and yet the milk kept curdling because there weren't enough grains, or just going yeasty. And they're growing very, very slowly. Two weeks later and I have a half teaspoon of grains. So far the milk has never smelled anything like kefir. In desperation I started adding some kefir powder and kefir, thinking that maybe they'd pick up some missing bacteria. Also, the instructions are misleading when they talk about it taking two weeks to ""rehydrate"". What you're doing is growing them to the point that you have enough to actually make kefir. I'm starting to think that dehydrated grains are a bad idea. But at the very least they ought to give you enough of them, instead of the tiny amount.<br /><br />Because it didn't seem like it was working very well, I ordered two tablespoons of live kefir grains from another vendor. They arrived yesterday, and I put them in milk. Today I think I have almost a quarter cup of grains.

I've previously made milk kefir from grains obtained through Marilyn ""Kefirlady"" and through the local leader of the Weston A. Price chapter. Both Kefirlady's and those obtained through Weston A. Price produced much better kefir. One of the main differences I could tell is that the kefir grains I've received from Cultures of Health do not create the ""slimy"" casing around the grains as I had experienced with other vendors. This leads me to believe that the grains are lacking some of the bacteria or yeasts that form the kefir grains. The taste is also not as sour as other previous grains. I understood that the first week or so of batches would not be up to par however I'm well past that.

The only ingredient is fair trade certified organic high mountain Yunnan Black Tea FOP (Flowery Orange Pekoe). There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: ""This noble tea is grown in the mist covered mountains of Yunnan province. What distinguishes this fine, organic black tea is its perfect sense of balance, exquisite tiger's eye color, and a lean vibrancy which makes it suitable at any time of day. Like a complex wine, it is the perfect tea for food, marrying well with a wide variety of dishes. It has a distant and hard to place floral quality, yet it leaves the mouth tasting as clean as spring water. And it energizes the body and mind more harmoniously than the best of coffees. We are proud to bring you this high grade leaf.""<br /><br />Although this tea says ""orange pekoe"", it does not taste citrus-y, but has a strong morning black tea taste with flowery overtones. It is like a regular orange pekoe upgraded many, many times, with something delicate, lovely, and flowery added. It's the perfect morning tea, or for anytime you want a high-quality pick-me-up.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry.

They all seem to have good flavors, good ingredients, and they don't have as high of calories as some of the others do.<br /><br />Cinnamon Coffee Cake really did taste like a cinnamon coffee cake.  It was pleasantly sweet, with that hint of spice from the cinnamon, and there was a little bit of sweet frosting stuff drizzled on top too.  It definitely had the crunch as well from the different grains the bar was made up of.  And I liked the crunch, it really made it feel like you were biting into something substantial.<br /><br />The ingredients are good in this bar.  Not the best out of all the brands out there, but still reasonably decent.  The main sweetener is Brown Rice Syrup, but there is also crystalline fructose and evaporated can juice crystals.  The grains are the Kashi seven grain blend that they like to advertise and there's wheat bran and a few other things included as well.  There are some hard to pronounce ingredients, but these appear to be the vitamins.<br /><br />This bar has 160 calories in it.  Not as much as some but still not enough to justify eating these as a snack.  Use them for when you're exercising, or don't have enough time for a full breakfast.  There is 5 grams of fiber and 8 grams of protein as well.  Although there are 13 grams of sugar, which seems a little high.  I do have to say that eating one of these bars does not make me as full as other bars do.  I started getting hungry around ten am after eating the bar at 8 am.  But it still did ok in that aspect, and maybe I was just hungrier than usual.<br /><br />A great flavored bar, I'd definitely buy it again.  I can just see it being a good one to take on a bike trip or some other kind of event.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012"

Put it in your machine, close the lid, open the lid, turn 90 degrees, close the lid and repeat two more times.  You should have closed the lid on the k-cup four times by now.  Next step is to hit the brew button.  The problem is the needle is too small to run the chocolate through.  With the extra three holes it all flows out very quick and turns out good.  Would have given them five stars if it was able to run through the needle like it is supposed to.  Could have been a little thicker overall, but not bad."

It's almost like there is artificial sweetener in them,, but I know there is not.<br />I set it on the smallest cup setting for cocoa.  This has more body to it than others.<br />I'm still waiting and hoping that Dunkin' Donuts will put out their hot cocoa in a k-cup.  There really is nothing better than that.<br />If you want a k-cup hot cocoa, I would def. recommend this over all the others."
567686,B005K4Q68Q,A1J75JJ0Q2OEJN,Raven A. Wind,187,216,3,1325808000,Why can't anyone make a hot cocoa without sucralose/Splenda in it?,"I HATE SUCRALOSE.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't know how other people CAN'T taste it when it's in sweetened products. It's got this unpleasant fake flavor that I just can't ignore. I think any company that uses that junk should be required by law to indicate it on their box and all advertising.<br /><br />That being said, it seems like this hot cocoa has less sucralose than the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa, and as such I have to give it higher marks than the competition.<br /><br />Still, I can't believe this product AND its nearest competitor use sucralose but don't say they're a diet, lite, low-sugar, or otherwise unnaturally-sweetened product. It's frustrating. I can taste the stuff, and I really dislike it. I also don't like the chemical makeup of sucralose, but I won't go into that here (just believe me: natural sugar is way better for you in the long run).<br /><br />There's one other choice out there for a hot cocoa in a K-Cup, and that's Swiss Miss. Unfortunately, the Swiss Miss K-Cups are ridiculously high priced and hard to find.<br /><br />My opinion? It's probably better if you just get your favorite hot cocoa in packets, and use the hot water function of your Keurig. It's not worth the K-Cup convenience if you have to put up with artificial sweeteners or significantly higher prices. Spending more than seventy-five cents per cup of water-based hot cocoa is about the limit for me.<br /><br />So, if you're into sucralose/Splenda, then by all means grab this and enjoy that weird aftertaste and decidedly not-sugar flavor. If you're like me, though, and can't stand that artificial stuff, then avoid this product and find another option.<br /><br />Three stars for tasting decent despite the awful artificial sweetener. Minus two stars for being artificially sweetened and not mentioning it anywhere.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I just found out that the Swiss Miss K-Cups also use sucralose. So really, your only choice is to get packets and use your Keurig as a hot water dispenser. How disappointing.<br /><br />UPDATE 02/12: After some research, I found that there is one K-Cup hot cocoa that doesn't have sucralose; However, it is loaded with fructose instead (not the greatest trade-off, since it tastes different from sugar/sucrose, in my opinion) and has no actual sugar/sucrose in it. That one is Green Mountain Coffee Hot Cocoa. Unfortunately, reviews of it say it has a strong coconut flavor (probably because the second ingredient is coconut oil) and is on the salty side, so I have avoided it. It's also more expensive per-cup, and unless you think a single cup of cocoa is worth over a dollar and twenty-five cents (as opposed to a box of 12 packets being around two dollars) then go ahead and try it. I will refrain at this point and stick to using packets.<br /><br />I would also like to clarify again that despite what some comments say, the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa K-Cups, Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa K-Cups, and Grove Square Hot Cocoa K-Cups ALL use sucralose. Yes, there is sugar in some of those, but it is IN ADDITION TO sucralose/Splenda, and not by itself.<br /><br />So your choices right now are pure sucralose, sucralose plus a sugar, or pure fructose. None of them is appetizing to me, and all of them make the cost per cup of cocoa quite unpleasant.<br /><br />43 servings of sugar-sweetened cocoa in a canister will run you around six bucks, and it's no more complicated than a K-Cup if you know how to operate a spoon."

567689,B005K4Q68Q,A3OAYBV9IQV33C,Rob,14,14,4,1323648000,Not bad. Not bad at all.,"I have read some really funny reviews about this product.  Some complain that there is noting left in the pod after it has filled the cup, so 'therefore' it must have been an instant mix!  Brilliant deduction, Sherlock!  What did you expect...to see choco-grounds in the cup?  Yes, it is no doubt cheaper to go some other route, that's why 4 instead of 5 stars.<br /><br />But the taste is what you want to know about, right?  The Dark Chocolate flavor is fairly robust with little 'grittyness' to it.  Plop a marshmallow in the cup before brewing and you'll have a real treat!  It comes out strong enough on either the 6 oz or 10 oz setting of the brewer.  Not surprisingly, the milk chocolate flavor is not as strong and a little smoother.  Marshmallow trick has a little different effect making the milk chocolate not only creamier and smoother but a little dilute too.  So, maybe a few mini-marshmallows instead of a full-sized one for this flavor.  Oh, and definitely go 6 oz cup.  My oldest granddaughter and I contest for the peppermint chocolate.  She wins, of course, but it's pretty good when I can get one.  No marshmallow needed.  The hint of peppermint is just enough.  6 oz cup on this one is the best way to go, too.<br /><br />I think I got the cups sizes right.  If I didn't, you'll figure it out.  Btw, I'd imagine the reason it's always out of stock is because people keep buying it!  I've dipped into the supply well a few times myself.  Pretty good. Pretty cheap. Pretty hard to get at times.

I haven't asked him if his family enjoyed it because I don't want to put him on the spot. Judging by the reviews, there are a lot of people who like it - hopefully, he will, too. Maybe it just depends on how your taste buds are trained. Mine grew up with hot chocolate made on the stove, with milk, cocoa and sugar, and maybe a tiny pinch of salt.  Compared to that, this stuff tastes like a chemical experiment.<br /><br />Anyway, instead of trying one of the other brands, I now heat some milk in the microwave, stir in a couple spoonfuls of Hershey's cocoa and some sugar to taste.

I saw the Grove Square brand and thought I would give it a try since I got 36 kcups for less than the 24 from Keurig. I received my purchase yesterday and immediately opened it up to try it.  The cocoa actually has sugar in it and the chocolately flavor is much better than the Cafe Escapes. I will be ordering this one again, and I hope my guest will drink the other kind to get rid of it!"

I was right about Grove Square being cheaper.

This hadn't been reviewed yet when I bought it, so I didn't see the warnings from others, and re-checked the ingredients several times to make sure.<br /><br />""Well... it's got 60 calories, which seems a bit lower than Green Mountain, but a bit high for something that diet-conscious people would want."" and the ingredient list didn't seem to point to obvious ""diet"" sweeteners.<br /><br />The overall taste is kind of like someone dropped a sugar-free Tootsie Roll in your hot water, using the normal cup setting. Going one size down didn't seem to improve much, beyond making a weak chocolate flavor sweeter - but that just meant a heavier shot of low-calorie sweetener to the taste buds.<br /><br />The way I see it, I saved about $5 by going with this brand. On the other hand, now I've got 20 of these cups left that are probably going in the trash if I can't sucker someone... er... please my discerning guests... with a few cups.<br /><br />If you drink diet soft drinks by choice, you're probably going to like this."

I really wanted to love this hot cocoa. I tried all three flavors multiple times, in different ways. I tried them on the different cup sizes, adding things, etc. There's just this strange taste to them that doesn't sit well on the tongue. I'm not sure what it is, but it has a faint ring of sour milk. It really lingers, and I haven't found anything that takes the taste away. I'm going to give my second box to a friend, she doesn't seem to notice it. My daughter and husband both said it tasted weird, so it's not just me. I also took it to a friend's house and have tried them in three different Keurig machines, JUST to make sure mine didn't need to be descaled.

If you read all the reviews on every product you'll discover that nothing gets past everyone and maintains a perfectly spotless reputation.  So I decided that even with some bad reviews I'd try this one since it has a lot of good reviews.  I'm just going to say that there are some real hot chocolate connoisseurs writing reviews in this thread.  Some discerning reviewers say it has a slight taste of sugar substitute, or some such thing.  All I can tell you is I must have under-achieving taste buds because all I can taste is yummy hot chocolate.  My family burned through the first box and I just ordered two more.  If you don't like this I feel sorry for you. Better to have numb taste buds I guess.  Enjoy."

The Grove Square Hot Chocolate is far superior.  I have so far brewed it on 6oz and 8oz with good flavor at both sizes.

Of course it's not going to be as good as melting your own chocolate in a pot of fresh milk, but I find it at least as tasty as any non-K-cup cocoa mix I've had. It is richer than the same company's milk-chocolate cocoa (which would, however, be my #2 pick of K-cup cocoas).<br /><br />One star off because of the fact that if you prepare a small cup, there will usually be some cocoa goop left behind in the K-cup, which you have to move to your mug if you want maximum-strength cocoa. Shaking the K-cup first to break up large chunks of powder as recommended on the package seems to help some."

You are much safer doing that with the fruit/veggie mixes.  Try before you buy seems like common sense.  However, the only store that carries this brand locally for me (Target) has a very limited selection so I couldn't let my son try this flavor before I bought it.  I imagine that is the same for other people shopping on-line.  I thought I could mix it with something else if he didn't care for it, but he will have nothing to do with it, mixed or otherwise.

We can eat the fruit varieties without even putting on a bib.  The Chick Chick is the man's favorite (bib required).

She likes them a lot so i wanted to try something with meat. This product has good reviews so I ordered it thinking you can't go wrong with sweet potatoes and chicken. But i was wrong it taste bad.My daughter won't eat it even when she is starving. She actually didn't want to eat anything for few hours after she tried it first time. I even spiced it up a little bit hoping that she likes it but nope:(I don't blame her.I don't like it either.<br /><br />Update: Few months later I reintroduced my daughter this product and she seems to like it now. She ate it well for week when we were traveling. I ordered another one for our upcoming trip.

My daughter eats this companies products all the time.  Chick Chick is great, Beef Stew is wonderful, but Gobble Gobble is weird.  My daughter didn't mind the taste, but I could not get over the texture.  It looked like a giant blob of wet dog food.  It was more putty-like than any other flavor.  I actually had to cut bites off of it.  I am grossed out just thinking about it.  Good thing there are other flavors."

It is so thick that my daughter grabs it out of her mouth after putting a bite in, which usually leads to a big mess. I now have to modify the texture by adding water to it, which does not make it a convenient food item when on the go. Since the pouches don't reseal this is even harder when traveling.<br /><br />Overall, the flavor seems good, just too thick. I still love the pouch design for the most part, since I can sometimes break the glass jars of other brands. I will just need to remember to pack some sandwich baggies in case it not working out when trying to eat it on the go."

I don't know why people are saying that it is gross or bitter.  It tastes like ministrone (an italian tomato-based soup with pasta and veggies).  My 7 1/2 month old loves it.  He is a really good eater in general but actually makes little ""mmms"" when he eats this meal.  Definitely warm it up.  It is really yummy!  I like the suggestion to serve with Avacado.  We give him avacado almost every day and the creamy texture is a wonderful compliment to the tomato/acidic flavor of this meal."

It is really liquid-y.. impossible for an unskilled/careless self-feeder to have much left on the spoon by the time it gets to her mouth (may be okay for younger babies who aren't self-feeding yet though). Also it only has 1g of protein now - not sure why / if there is less salmon in it? Anyway, it's off the menu here, and I am disappointed to have lost a healthful, convenient option."

I only buy organic food for him and Chick Chick is one of his favorites.  I tasted it and it's a little bland for me but I'm also not a baby.  He loves it and as long as he does, I'll keep it stocked for him.  I love the Happy Baby/Happy Tot brand and the variety they offer.  I prefer jars for convenience but I just empty this into a jar to heat.  I did find that one of the pouches had a leak at a seam.  I'm glad that I saw it before I gave it to him.  Now I check them each thoroughly before I open them.  If I can squeeze food out of a seam, it gets pitched."

The second ingredient behind water was tomatoes and it was evident in the taste of the product.  It didn't seem to have even a trace taste of beef.  Because of the high tomato content, the stew was very acidic.  I was a bit disappointed by this product."

I really don't like trying to puree meat so I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package and it actually tasted great and wasn't lumpy.

I was a little surprised to see the reviews that said it is dry and tastes bad.  I wonder if those were bad packets.  The ones we've had have always been moist.  The food is a little bit bland, but it is not recommended to feed babies salt or spices, so it's about what I'd expect.  I like this better than the Chick Chick because it has a firmer texture.  To me, the Chick Chick is runny.  I normally spoon feed this to our baby, but if I don't mind cleaning up a mess I sometimes allow her to eat it with her hands.  We've never had any problems with gagging or choking.  When the packet is empty she's still looking for more.  I make most of my daughter's baby food and am very particular about what packaged foods I give to her.  I feel okay about this one because there are no weird preservatives and I can identify all of the ingredients."

My little one LOVES his pouches, but this is one he would not have.  After tasting it, I had to agree with him.  Maybe he does not like green peppers either.  If I recall correctly, the ingredients do not have yellow or red peppers as shown on the picture, but rather there are green peppers.  I was very disappointed as it looked good in the picture, it sounded nice & healthy, and my baby loves all their other products.  I'd suggest you try ONE pouch to see if you like it before you purchase several."

(Exclusively BF) First couple of bits he gagged quite a bit, so we simply stuck it in our little $10 food processer from Wal-Mart and added 1/4 of a banana.  He wolfed it down like nothing.

Most cats will run at the sound of a can opener, mine have learned to listened for the tearing of the pouch.  If you get this flavor and your baby hates it- you can always use it as cat food.  The texture of this particular product is pretty good for my now 10 month old.  I got a Sprout product with lentils in it and he spit the lentils out.  It is kind of hit and miss with the textures of these foods because their rating has no consistency.  That's my one- and constant- complaint."

I'd eat it myself, but it is way too thick.  I got a case of it, so I'm going make it work.  So- I put the too watery stage 2 spinach mango pear and stage 3 mama grain in the blender and voila! Perfect texture.  Easy enough fix, however- I buy premade baby food because I don't want to blend my own.  I did with my 1st baby, but this is my 4th, and the novelty of making baby food, and the time required to do it- is long gone.  Happy Baby would do well to be more consistent in their labeling.  Their Stage 2 food should be 1.5, and this stage 3 should be 3.75."

Yellow curry was recommended, and the coconut milk based Thai version was a treat with both seafood and chicken-something I've had occasion to order again and again.<br /><br />So when trying to re-create the taste sensations above, I was less than thrilled at the idea of grinding individual spices, purchasing a number of pricey ingredients with limited shelf life and narrow applications.<br /><br />I did some research and found that many Thai housewives rely on the time and labor savings of using high quality curry pastes as the basis for soups, curries and more. Mae Ploy was one of the brands repeatly mentioned as high quality and fresh tasting.<br /><br />This brand comes in a handful of flavors and heat levels, with the Yellow Curry Paste being the first I was eager to try. It has a shelf life of 2 years, and the large plastic pouch also keeps very well nestled in its own colorful tub in the refrigerator.<br /><br />The flavors of lemon grass, shallot, gingery galanga, kaffir lime peel, warm spices and red chili are very well balanced. This is the only Mae Ploy Curry paste without shrimp paste, making it vegan-suitable as well as delicious with shellfish, fish or fowl.<br /><br />I like to snip off one corner of the clear packet, then squeeze out just the amount I need-anywhere from 1/2 teaspoon to 2 Tablespoons, depending on the recipe. This helps to maintain freshness and flavor and avoid waste.<br /><br />For Thai curry, I will combine the Yellow Curry Paste with a small amount of chicken broth, then add 3/4 Cup more broth per person, plus a can of coconut milk to mellow and round the flavor. A cup or two of chunked seafood or chicken, plus cubed potatoes and onion-simmered together for about 30 minutes- makes a very satisfying dish to serve with either traditional sticky rice or more the more occidental long grain variety.<br /><br />Mae Ploy's Thai Yellow Curry is also delicious with just a bit added to your favorite dip, salad dressing, or try a teaspoonful combined with 1 cup of sour cream or plain yogurt 'painted' over your favorite fish fillets and baked just until cooked through, (about 15-20 minutes at 325).<br /><br />The fine quality of this product has encouraged me to order another flavorful curry paste-also excellent-and I would highly recommend this product for those wishing to re-create favorite restaurant fare at a reasonal price, without tedious preparation."

It comes in a plastic tub with an inner sealed bag so it should stay fresh longer if it is not opened right away. The flavor was more multidimensional than some other curry pastes we have tried. The heat level was just about right for us (we like some heat but not enough to overpower other flavors - the tongue should tingle a bit but not go numb). We still start with some chopped onions and sometimes add more ginger paste but the yellow curry is pretty good right out of the tub. The recipe on the tub suggests 50 grams of paste. We checked with a scale and 1 tablespoon is roughly 25 g (so 2 tablespoons of paste). We like it with a bit less - one and a half tablespoons for the given recipe otherwise it was too hot.

Though currently at $59.99 for a 54 ct, the price is not part of my review.  I'm sure it'll come down eventually.<br /><br />I've been drinking Pike Place for 10+ years now.  As soon as I got my Keurig, I started looking for a suitable replacement blend.  Although there are plenty of fine K-cups to be found, none quite fit the bill.  I ended up just grinding my own Pike Place and brewing it with a Solofill, which was not ideal for two reasons; 1.  The Solofill does not have enough capacity to get the full flavor.  2.  I'm lazy and this defeats the purpose of a Keurig brewer in the first place.<br /><br />There is a reason that Pike Place put Starbucks on the map nearly 40 years ago.  It is THE perfect medium blend.  There is plenty of flavor for dark coffee drinkers to enjoy, and is not too rich or 'burnt' for light coffee drinkers.  It's bright, but not too bright.<br /><br />Does the K-cup version do it justice?  Yes.  Everything I mentioned above is in this little cup.  I just got home with these an hour ago, and 3 cups later, I can honestly say my prayers have been answered.<br /><br />You know what?  Even at $59.99, this review would be 5 stars.  It's that good."

I have a special affinity to Pike Place in Seattle, and this coffee has a particular taste that brings me a sense of the place. It is robust with a flavor of  cocoa and toasted nuts. It is subtle with a smooth body. As an aside, Starbucks opened  their first store in the Pike Place Market in 1971.<br /><br />When I received my Keurig, I hoped to find Pike Place K-Cups, and that was one of my first purchases. The coffee has the exact flavor and is so delicious! It is so easy and convenient to order from Amazon.

But if you like the stronger style of coffee Starbucks is known for, you'll be a bit disappointed. I don't plan to buy this again.<br /><br />So again, not bad, but nothing special.

I was so elated when I found out that Starbucks was now going to be in Keurig form, let alone this flavor.  I normally can not stand coffee with cream and sugar.  I enjoy my coffees, black, no cream or sugar, and STRONG.  This one is the lone exception.  Starbucks claims this is a medium roast.  Take it with a grain of salt.  It has a fantastic aroma but a bitter taste, with also a bit of an aftertaste.  The first time I had this at a Starbucks, I wanted to throw this out.  To be honest, it was nasty, but with the price of a Starbucks coffee, at their coffee shop, I refused to give in.  I added (2) packets of sugar, along with some half & half, and ""Oh my God"", I was in heaven.  I should say, this is for an 8oz cup.  Not only is this so good, it's actually my favorite coffee.<br /><br />Now with the K-Cup version... to make the equivalent, I select an 8oz brew, use half & half to where it's a medium brown, and (2) packets of Splenda.  Splenda, in coffee tastes as good as sugar.  I'm diabetic.  This tastes as good as if it was from their coffee shop.<br />Since this can get expensive if your going to have more than (2) cups a day, I've decided to purchase this in 1lb bags and use the ""ekobrew Cup, Refillable Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers"", to make this more cost effective.<br /><br />The bottom line is I think if you, like me, don't like this coffee, by itself, try it with cream and sugar.  You'll be surprised at the difference in taste.<br /><br />By the way... why this says I'm in New Caledonia, I have no idea nor can I get it to change.  I'm from NJ."

I ordered and received a Brand New B145 OfficePRO model, a supposedly 'Heavy-Duty' Keurig Model ...<br />In January, I started to put the Keurig thru it's paces, along side the Tassimo, and frankly the Tassimo is still SUPERIOR, in the way that it Brews for Better Flavor, has a Faster Brewing Cycle, and heats the H2O to the Optimal Temperature, than the Keurig, which BTW, is/was a lot NOSIER than the Tassimo. In all fairness, this could be  a 'technical' problem with the Bar Code settings on the K-Cups. Note , that I continued to also use my Red Tassimo unit, as it is/was the only coffee unit to use the Milk Creamers, as Keurig still does not offer that option, anywhere!<br /><br />In February, I left on a 3-week trip, and as I always do, I turned off all the unnecessary electric Household appliances.<br />When I returned back in this month of March, I was so PISSED to find out that the Brand New Keurig was totally INOPERABLE!<br />Nada! Zip! Zero! Despite, doing everything that was Recommended on Forums (don't go the Keurig Forums, as they are so Worthless!)<br />Now, I have a large, fancy Keurig BRICK that I am attempting to get a Refund for, so stay tuned!<br /><br />* Pike Place + Colombian + Folgers are the different varieties that I tried on the New Keurig machine.<br />  The Colombian was the Best of the lot.<br /><br />Read my comments, after each bullet item:<br /><br />  * Features fresh Starbucks coffee in an easy-to-brew single-cup (K-Cup) serving. - Not as good as the Tassimo, which is about<br />  2 Steps BELOW a StarBucks Coffee House. I often found the Keurig ""Brew"" to be a tad Watery, not Rich & Flavorful.<br /> * Brews in 1 minute or less, so you can grab a cup when you're in a rush. - BUT, you have to Turn the Unit ON FIRST,<br />  so that it will Warm Up first, before the Blue Light comes on, indicating that it is ready to start brewing.<br /> * Medium Roast Ground Coffee - They call it 'Medium', but I think it's more MILD!<br /> * Smooth & Balanced - Disagree, Balanced with What? Tea?<br /> * Rumor of a Sale Price of only 38 buckaroos at Sam's Club & Costco - I cannot confirm this rumor.<br /><br />* There is now a New Rumor that StarBucks is going to be offering their Consumer Coffee Machine in the fall!<br /><br />Stay Tuned!"

The price may seem high compared to table salt, but Amazon's price is low compared to other places I've bought it. Definitely worth it, in my opinion.<br /><br />One thing to note is that this sea salt is very moist, so it doesn't work well in a grinder or shaker.

I recently began using Salmon in the pouch and really like how convenient it is to use and it taste great. The pouch is very easy to open just by tearing the top of the pouch which has a pre-made notch to initiate an easy opening. Once the pouch is open it is not resealable. The Salmon can be eaten directly out of the pouch or you can empty the contents to make a salad or other meal. I now keep some of these Salmon pouches at work and I carry a few in my every day carry (EDC) bag in case I get stuck somewhere and need a quick, easy, and healthy snack to keep me going. I also carry some when hiking, backpacking, or camping.<br /><br />The pouch is relatively strong and would not easily be punctured by an object. As a precaution I do wrap the pouch in a one gallon freezer bag when carrying the Salmon in my EDC bag just as an added measure of caution. Each pouch is considered one portion and contains 70 calories with 20 calories from fat. Each serving contains 13 grams of protein. The pouch has a label stating that the product is skinless and boneless. This Salmon is a good source of protein and Omega-3 fatty acids. The Salmon is labeled as a product of Thailand and the expiration date is over 2 years from that date that I purchased the Salmon so it will last awhile and there is no need to be concerned about the expiration date. I have seen this product on sale at a local grocery store for under a dollar which is a great deal.<br /><br />Overall, I am very satisfied with this product and would highly recommend Chicken of the Sea Premium Wild-Caught Pink Salmon Pouch to others."

All I can say is that if you don't have home roasted peppers on hand these grilled piquillo peppers will definitely fit the bill.  These are the tastiest purchased grilled/roasted peppers that we have ever tasted and I think we are roasted pepper connoisseurs.  This company also does sell a roasted piquillo pepper which for our taste is not quite as tasty as the grilled.  Don't get me wrong, their roasted are also good, but the grilled are over the top.  I do ""roast"" my own and the way I do them we as well as anyone who has ever tasted them go crazy for them.  But again, if you need or would rather purchase cooked peppers the DeLallo Grilled Piquillo Pepper will not disappoint you.  I usually purchase them at the store, however, when I checked the price of them online there was quite a savings at Amazon for a case of 12.  The case arrived in good condition and the jars had an appropriate expiration date on them.  No matter where you get them they are a little pricey, but someone grew and cared for these peppers, grilled, jared, labeled and shipped them.  Allot went into these little jars.  Whenever you see red peppers know that whoever grew them took care of them much longer to get them to the red stage rather than picking green.  I make my own salad dressings and I do add the liquid from the jar to my dressing.  The liquid is  flavored with the natural oil from the peppers and is delicious.  Try them!  You'll like them!"

I have not tried the bulk product.<br /><br />This is a great alternative sweetener. It leaves no after taste that I can detect. I use it in tea, on cereal and in three different kinds of oatmeal. Everything that I have used it in or on has tasted the same as it did when sugar was used.<br /><br />I cam accross a couple of articles on Stevia while browsing on the Internet. After reading those two articles I did a little more research and decided to try Stevia. I found this product at our local Kroger store where it happened to be on sale. Kroger carries two ro three other Stevia based products however after comparing the list of ingredients for each I decided to buy the Stevia In The Raw. The list of ingredients for the packet form of this product is dextrose and Stevia Extract (Rebiana).<br /><br />OK, I tired it and it tastes great in everyhting I have used it with but I was curious. The Stevia extract is supposed to be 200 to 400 times more intensely sweet than sugar. If that is the case why was dextrose used and why was it the more prevalent ingredient? I called the company on their 800 and asked this same question. The answer is (according to them) that dextrose is a carbohydrate derived from crushed corn. It is a filler in their product. The Rebiana is so intensely sweet that it was impractical to package it in its pure form in individual packets. The volume would be so small that consumers would wonder if anything was really there. To me this sounds plausible. I am not a dietician, a doctor nor do I work for the company. I simply use their product and like it.<br /><br />I hope this info is helpful. Everyone have a gret day out there."
568250,B00374ZKQ0,A17V9XL4CWTQ6G,Chandler,38,45,1,1320192000,You'll need 3 packs to equal one pack of Truvia. Not a bargain.,"First of all, I have no ties with Truvia. In fact, I decided to replace my Truvia recently with Stevia in the Raw which is why I'm now typing this. In my grocery store the Stevia in the Raw was cheaper. I'd always felt Truvia expensive, so I was all over that.<br /><br />While I personally do not believe the phrase ""You get what you pay for"" since sometimes a consumer is only paying for more marketing in a more expensive product...in this case, it's true.<br /><br />I do like sugar in the raw and I do buy it. It's way better than regular sugar being bleached and processed through bone char (for reals).<br /><br />But, first of all, this isn't ""in the raw"". That would mean it's pure Stevia. It also contains Dextrose. Dextrose is a very cheap additive that's sweet that's made from corn. It's high carb. Great if you just finished a tough workout and need carbs. Not great if you call yourself Stevia in the RAW<br /><br />Having formerly worked in food chemical sales, I know that Dextrose is Glucose. This is not an artificial additive, however diabetes is caused by high levels of glucose in the blood. I therefore find it quite scary that this is labeled ""raw"" when diabetics may use it or someone wishing to avoid sugar would use it.  Now granted, Truvia has a fruit sweetener in it as well, because stevia is actually SO sweet that you'd have hardly anything in a pack otherwise because it takes very little stevia to sweeten something, but it's not calling itself ""raw"" either.<br /><br />But let's bypass that and take our sugar/stevia packs and move on. Is the rest the same?<br /><br />Huh-uh.<br /><br />You get 50 packs of Stevia in the Raw in a box.<br />You get 40 packs of Truvia in a box.<br /><br />Superb huh?<br /><br />Likely, because Stevia in the Raw was a tiny bit less expensive, you will do as I did and think ""Woo Hoo! I get more for less!"" Aw, those marketing dogs saw me coming a mile away.<br /><br />Not so fast.<br /><br />I kept making my coffee and hating the taste of it. Bitter.  I began adding 2 packs of Stevia in the Raw. Still not sweet. I had just bought a new coffee and I was thinking it must be stronger of something. Then I found a pack of Truvia I had in the drawer and realized how much MORE was in the pack simply by picking up the pack. I added that one pack to my coffee and it tasted, finally, sweet again.<br /><br />So that got me thinking...<br /><br />I go to the Stevia in the Raw box and look at the net weight of those 50 packets.<br />It is 1.75 ounces.<br />I then, when shopping again, pick up a box of Truvia (and buy it of course because I'm tired of coffee tasting unsweetened.) and for 40 packets it's 4.9 ounces!!!!<br /><br />WOA! I've just been had. I have to use about 3-4 of those Stevia in the Raw packets to equal the taste of one Truvia packet because there is next to nothing inside the packet..just as I suspected. They gave me more packets with less inside each one. So I have to waste paper, and time opening packet after packet just for one cup o' joe.<br /><br />And quite frankly, I don't like deceptive marketing and it's going on all over every 1.75 ounce box of Stevia in the Raw.<br /><br />But, wait...one more thing...<br /><br />Because Stevia in the Raw has sugar in it in glucose form, is it really 0 calories for the same amount? or just a low amount in one packet but by the time you use 4, how many calories may have snuck in....because 0.5 calories can add up too.  Not that I care about 4 calories or 2 calories, but in comparing the two products, and how little is in a packet of Stevia in the Raw...<br /><br />It wouldn't surprise me.<br /><br />Truvia, by the way, has Erythritol in it. This is one of the best all-natural zero calorie sweeteners you can buy. The Brand Z Sweet is erythritol. It's great for diabetics and dieters because it's the one that will NOT spike your blood sugar but is still all-natural. Stevia is so lightweight it needs a counterpart. Erythritol is a stevia cousin. Dextrose is a cheap filler that isn't."
568251,B00374ZKQ0,A1I1V7QUWSMYGA,Your Online Bookstore,13,15,5,1265760000,This is the only brand out there with minimal aftertaste,"I'm not 100% certain this is the same product sold at [...], but this is the only place I could find to review it, and I wanted to review it somewhere.  I love this stuff.  I've tried all the major stevia brands (including everything at Whole Foods), and Stevia in the Raw (which Whole Foods doesn't carry, sadly) is the only brand that doesn't taste like crap.  All other brands have a heavy bitter-licorice aftertaste.  Stevia in the Raw is unique in that I can put the powder itself to my tongue without grimacing.  I can't even do that with ""normal"" (i.e. toxic) sweeteners like NutraSweet or Equal (though Splenda tastes fine raw.)  I suppose I have a somewhat sensitive palate, and with the heavy amounts of sweetener I use, I can still detect a slight aftertaste even with Stevia in the Raw -- so if you're a heavy user with a sensitive palate, then just combine it with some erythritol and you're good to go.  No aftertaste whatsoever with that combo.  And this is way better for you than any other (palatable) sweetener."

NO FUNKY AFTERTASTE!!!,"I've tried for years and years to like stevia, but it's always left a funky aftertaste in my mouth that just ruined it's use for me. Until now, the most tolerable of the stevias was the vanilla cream by sweetleaf, but even that left the funky after taste.<br /><br />A few months ago I decided to go on a marathon stevia taste test adventure and bought almost every brand out there to give them each a go. I didn't have high expectations as I fully expected them all to leave me with the funky taste. I did not do truvia, because it has another added sweetener - it is not pure stevia. I only tested those that were pure stevia plain flavor and vanilla flavor (since the sweetleaf vanilla had been the best one so far).<br /><br />I was shocked beyond belief when using the stevia in the raw and not having any funky after taste! I tried it many different ways - in chai tea, to sweeten hot breakfast cereal, for baking and cooking sweet treats, etc. and no aftertaste! I also tried larger quantities, as sometimes the more you use the increased after taste. So far no matter what I've done with this stevia I've had NO aftertaste what-so-ever!!!<br /><br />If you've tried to like stevia and just can't get past the after taste then give stevia in the raw a go - I think you'll be very surprised and pleased as I've been.

568254,B00374ZKQ0,AOJTB8BZVZQPP,Frankie,8,10,5,1282694400,Very good stevia without any extra ingredients.,"I bought them at Shoprite (at 3.79 for a box of 50, its cheaper than from this seller) and I am so happy that I can enjoy sweet things again!  I compared it to other sweetners such as truvia and purvia, I like this product because I won't support coca cola(maker of truvia) or pepsi (maker of purvia) if i buy this.  Also, there is only two ingredients : dextrose and stevia extract.  Each pack is 1 gram, so I assume there is maybe 0.9 gram of which is dextrose, which IS a sugar, but the FDA allows the labeling to be such that if a serving is under 4 calories, it can be called 'zero-calories'.<br /><br />To my understanding, dextrose is needed as the bulking agent (probably stevia extract is so potent, no one can use it if its in pure form) Online searching have shown dextrose contains 3.7 cal per gram, so if you have to use many packets for your tea or coffee, it won't be calories-free.  BUT, 3 packets of this (maybe like 10 cal) made my 12 oz of water with lemon juice taste like a real cup of lemonade made with real sugar, and THAT would be like 110 calories. And it taste so much better and healthier than splenda."

The National Cancer Institute ran studies in the next 2 years and found that saccharin was indeed connected with bladder cancer.

The only pure stevia brand I have found is SweetLeaf Stevia - it is not as delicious and most certainly has a bit of an aftertaste, but I have gotten used to it since I have a blood sugar problem and can't consume sugar. My advice is that unless you physically cannot handle sugar, a small amount of raw sugar is much better for you than all this artificial crap. Just be smart about the stevia bandwagon everyone is jumping on, because pretty much every brand out there is just some other sweetener mixed with stevia and then sold as 'healthy'."

I didn't really care for the oats & chocolate, but I like the oats & peanut butter a lot.  It tastes very good with a nice mellow peanut butter flavor.  Even my young boys (6 and 3) like it.  As good as oats & peanut butter is, though, the caramel is 10 times better.  It tastes like a candy bar. Obviously, it has a firm texture, but it's not dry by any stretch.  It makes a great breakfast or part of a breakfast that can stick with you for a few hours.  It can also serve as a very satisfying snack.  I will confess that, since my supply of these bars has been limited, I haven't had my kids try them yet.  But, now that I have been finally able to order these from Amazon, I will definitely let them try this new flavor."
568305,B0013Z0PTW,A1HHEMY96W1M1V,Autodidact,3,3,3,1305244800,Inulin -- take it slowly!,"Inulin, found in chicory root, is the key ingredient here; everything else in the bar is designed to make it possible for you to eat the inulin.  Search the web on inulin (not insulin!) -- it is being touted as a wonderful probiotic ingredient.  And there's no question that eating these bars will make the trains run on time, so to speak.<br /><br />The problem is that not everyone tolerates inulin well, and tolerance is at different doses.  Some people experience gas, cramps, frequent bowel movements with tarry stool, and other kinds of GI distress.  This is not because of the increase in fiber per se -- it is a reaction to the specific fiber here, inulin.<br /><br />The bars are very sweet but don't treat them like a snack until you know how your body reacts.  (I read with horror the account of one person who sat down with a box and polished off four or five in a sitting.) Take it very very slowly.  I can tolerate one (1) bite of a bar a day; more than that and I get in trouble, period.  At one bite a day, this case of bars is lasting me a long, long time.  On the other hand, I'm not worried about the calories in the bar at that rate either.<br /><br />If you don't finish a bar you need to keep it in a baggie or container because it will dry out and become substantially less appealing.  Taste is fine, but I wish I had gotten the chocolate so that I could get my choco fix on at the same time."

I typically enjoy these in the afternoon to carry me through between lunch and dinner but have eaten them for breakfast on occasion as well and they keep me satisfied until lunch.

If you don't have many of the aforementioned foods in your daily diet, then one or two of these a day may be a good fiber supplement. However, this comes at the cost of making you extremely gassy all through the day, which can be embarrassing and sometimes even annoying when it's more frequent than the occasional toot that slips out. IMHO, it's better to get the daily dietary fiber your body needs via the more natural means that I mentioned above.<br /><br />Another thing to keep in mind, especially when dieting, is that these bars are pretty high in sugar. (As much as 10g added sugar per bar!) Considering a ""healthy"" amount of added sugar per day maxes out at about 40-50g per day, eating a few of these bars will chew right through that cap in no time. There's also emerging research showing that eating high-sugar foods (like fiber one bars) will make you crave more sweets, leading you to eat or drink even more unhealthy things like candy bars and sodas. So if you're on a diet, eating these bars probably aren't as great for your diet as you think!<br /><br />I've been fiber one free for two weeks now and I'm happy for the decision.

And it makes me feel very good to know I'm not jacking up my blood sugar level with sugar, and that I'm not putting sugar (which I increasingly think of as poison) into my body.  But you do have to use around the same amount as regular sugar, maybe sometimes less, sometimes more.  Various mfgs. of the product claim you can use less.

(They also eat the kitten versions of Fancy Feast wet canned food; it used to be 1 can per cat daily, but we've cut down to half a can per cat daily.  Catmium was gobbling her wet food and then eating Wolfram's, and Wolfram was letting her, preferring to eat dry food; he likes the crunchiness.  Catmium didn't need two cans a day, so now we just put out one can a day and they eat dry food if they don't get enough of the wet.)

I wanted to make some on my own, and I tried many brands and recipes, including making it from scratch.  This is the best tea I found. In my opinion, steeping tea bags makes a weak, bland tea.  You really need to use loose tea and cook it according to the directions.  I use half and half for the milk, and it makes a rich, spicy tea.  Additionally, for the sweetener, I use maple syrup instead of honey or sugar.  It might sound odd, but the maple syrup blends with the chai spices much better.
